# agmsg — Design & Architecture

*[日本語](design.ja.md)*

Developer documentation for contributors and maintainers.

## Identity Model

An agent is identified by `(name, team)`. Project path and agent type (claude-code, codex, gemini) are metadata — reference information stored alongside the identity but not part of it.

- An agent can be registered from multiple projects under the same name
- `whoami.sh` uses project path and type to suggest an identity, but the user can choose any name
- See [#15](https://github.com/fujibee/agmsg/issues/15) for the ongoing identity redesign

## Data Storage

### Messages — SQLite

`~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/db/messages.db`

- Path resolved by `scripts/lib/storage.sh` (`agmsg_db_path`); override the storage directory with `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH` (env > built-in default). Scoped to the SQLite store only.
- WAL journal mode for concurrent access (multiple readers + 1 writer)
- Schema:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    team TEXT NOT NULL,
    from_agent TEXT NOT NULL,
    to_agent TEXT NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ', 'now')),
    read_at TEXT
  );
  ```
- Indexes on `(team, to_agent, read_at)` for unread queries and `(team, created_at)` for history

### Team Config — JSON

`~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/teams/<team>/config.json`

```json
{
  "name": "myteam",
  "agents": {
    "alice": { "type": "claude-code", "project": "/path/to/project" }
  },
  "created_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Manipulated via sqlite3 JSON1 functions (no python3 dependency).

### User Config — YAML

`~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/db/config.yaml`

```yaml
# agmsg configuration
hook:
  check_interval: 60  # seconds between inbox checks
```

Read/written by `config.sh` using awk. Supports dotted keys (`hook.check_interval`).

## Hook System

Auto message detection uses the host agent's hook mechanism to check for new messages after each response.

### Flow

```
Agent responds → Stop hook fires → check-inbox.sh runs
  ├─ Cooldown active? → skip (Codex: JSON systemMessage)
  ├─ No unread messages? → silent (Codex: JSON systemMessage)
  └─ Unread messages found:
       1. Build notification text
       2. Mark messages as read_at
       3. Return JSON { "decision": "block", "reason": "..." }
       4. Agent sees messages in context and continues
```

### Cooldown

A marker file (`run/.lastcheck-<agent>`) tracks the last check time. Configurable via `hook.check_interval` (default 60 seconds). It lives in the run dir (hook runtime state), not the message store, so it is unaffected by `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH`.

### Claude Code vs Codex

| Aspect | Claude Code | Codex |
|---|---|---|
| Hook config | `.claude/settings.local.json` | `.codex/hooks.json` |
| Feature flag | Not needed | `codex_hooks = true` in `config.toml` |
| Silent output | exit 0 with no output | JSON `{ "continue": true }` |
| New messages | `decision: "block"` | `decision: "block"` |
| UI label | "Stop hook error:" ([#2](https://github.com/fujibee/agmsg/issues/2)) | "warning:" ([#2](https://github.com/fujibee/agmsg/issues/2)) |

### Project resolution ([#92](https://github.com/fujibee/agmsg/issues/92))

Slash commands pass `"$(pwd)"` as the project key. When the user `cd`s into a
subdirectory or git worktree of the project the session actually lives in, that
pwd no longer matches the registered project — lookups miss and a phantom record
gets minted for the subdir. `lib/resolve-project.sh` recovers the real root with
three signals, none needing a stable `session_id` (Codex doesn't expose one):

1. **Per-process marker.** At SessionStart, `proj.<agent_pid>.project` records
   the authoritative project (the hook's baked-in `$2`), keyed by the enclosing
   agent process PID. A slash command runs as a child of that same process, so
   it walks the ppid chain to the agent PID and reads the marker back. Trust is
   gated on the PID still being a live agent process (recycling guard); stale
   markers are GC'd at SessionStart/SessionEnd. **Claude Code monitor/both
   only** — Codex rejects monitor mode (no Monitor tool), so it never installs
   `session-start.sh` and writes no marker; Codex relies on signals 2–3.
2. **Ancestor walk.** Failing a marker, the nearest ancestor of pwd that is a
   registered project for the type wins. Git-independent — covers nested
   subdirs and worktrees that live *under* the registered project, on cc and
   Codex alike.
3. **Git common-dir.** Failing that, the registered main checkout of pwd's git
   repo (via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`), recovering a *sibling* worktree
   the ancestor walk cannot reach. Validated against the registry, so it
   declines when registration sits on an umbrella parent dir.

Order: marker → ancestor → git-common-dir → pwd (unchanged fallback).
Resolution is applied by the agent-driven entry points (`whoami.sh`,
`actas-claim.sh`, `join.sh`, `reset.sh`, and `watch.sh` — whose subscription
must track the same resolved project); direct shell invocations and
`spawn.sh`'s explicit `--project` opt out via `AGMSG_RESOLVE_PROJECT=0`.
`identities.sh` stays a pure lookup — its callers pass an already-resolved path.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `internal/init-db.sh` | Create SQLite database with schema |
| `send.sh` | Insert a message into the database |
| `inbox.sh` | Show unread messages and mark as read |
| `history.sh` | Show message history (newest first, displayed oldest first) |
| `join.sh` | Add agent to team (create team if needed) |
| `leave.sh` | Remove agent from team (delete team if empty) |
| `team.sh` | List team members |
| `whoami.sh` | Identify agent by project path and type |
| `rename.sh` | Rename agent in config and message history |
| `check-inbox.sh` | Hook entry point — cooldown, check, notify |
| `config.sh` | Read/write user config (YAML) |

All scripts use only `bash` and `sqlite3`. No python3 dependency.

Claude Code command is installed separately to `~/.claude/commands/<cmd>.md`.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are scoped to the feature that needs them, not installed up
front as one bundle — a local-only install stays minimal, and each
additional feature brings only the binaries it personally needs (settled
2026-07-25: "dependencies stay closed to the scope of the feature
that needs them"; the specific tiers below are that principle applied to
the facts of the current codebase, checked directly rather than assumed —
an earlier draft of this section wrongly implied a single linear
core→E2EE→remote chain and missed that Node is required independent of
either).

- **core (local-only messaging)** — `bash`, `sqlite3` (database and JSON
  manipulation via the JSON1 extension), `awk`/`sed` (config, TOML
  editing). Covers `send`/`inbox`/`history`/`team`/`join`/`leave`/`rename`
  and everything else that only talks to the local SQLite store. No
  python3, no node, no network, no daemon.
- **codex agent type / launcher-based spawn** — core, plus `node`
  (`scripts/lib/node.sh` resolves it; the Codex monitor delivery bridge,
  `codex-bridge.js`, is a Node program). `spawn.sh` dies explicitly
  (`'node' not found on PATH — spawning '<type>' requires Node.js`) for
  any agent type with a launcher. Independent of E2EE/remote below —
  this dependency already exists on `main`.
- **E2EE (end-to-end-encrypted team keys)** — core, plus `age`/`age-keygen`
  (`key.sh`). Only needed if a team uses an encrypted key profile.
- **remote control plane (connect/status/disconnect/pending, team list)**
  — core, plus `python3` (`remote.sh`, `team-list.sh`, and their
  `scripts/internal/*.py` helpers, which do strict response/config
  validation in Python rather than reimplementing that logic in bash).
  Only needed if a team connects to the sync service. Every entry point
  calls `agmsg_require_python3` (`scripts/lib/require-python3.sh`) before
  its first `python3` invocation and fails fast with an install message
  if it's unusable — modeled on `key.sh`'s existing `age` preflight
  check. This matters beyond a clean error message: on macOS, invoking a
  bare `python3` when Xcode Command Line Tools aren't installed triggers
  the OS's own CLT-install dialog rather than a normal "not found" error.
  Worse, `command -v python3` alone cannot detect this case — Apple ships
  a `/usr/bin/python3` trampoline that genuinely exists on PATH even
  without CLT installed, so a plain PATH check reports success right up
  until something actually executes it. The check additionally consults
  `xcode-select -p` (a real, always-present, non-interactive binary that
  only inspects installed-tool state) whenever python3 resolves to
  exactly `/usr/bin/python3` on Darwin — python3 itself is never executed
  to probe for its own usability, on any platform, under any
  circumstance; "try running it and see what happens" is exactly the
  category of fix this exists to avoid.
- **remote sync data plane (the Stage-1 polling sync client)** — core,
  plus `node` (`remote-sync.sh` execs `internal/remote-sync.mjs` and its
  companion `.mjs` helpers via `AGMSG_SYNC_NODE_BIN`/`agmsg_resolve_node`).
  A second, independent reason a remote-connected team needs Node,
  separate from the control plane's python3 need above.

`doctor` (`remote.sh doctor`) checks `age` and `python3`, sharing the same
judgment helper (`agmsg_python3_usable`) that the control-plane preflight
uses, so the diagnostic display and the actual gate can never disagree.
It does not yet check `node` for the sync data plane — a gap, not a
design choice; `remote-sync.sh` still fails with whatever raw error
`agmsg_resolve_node`'s fallback produces if Node is missing.

No persistent daemon at any tier. The core tier alone makes no network
calls; the remote tiers do, by definition.
