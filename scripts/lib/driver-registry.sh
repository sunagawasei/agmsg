# Driver registry — axis-generic discovery + trust policy.
#
# agmsg's pluggable units are "drivers" grouped by axis (ADR 0001 / docs/spec/
# driver-interface.md). The agent-type registry (type-registry.sh) is the first
# consumer (axis = "types"); storage and delivery axes reuse the same machinery.
#
# This lib knows NOTHING about a given axis's internal layout (types use a
# directory with type.conf; another axis may differ). It only provides:
#   - the ordered search BASES   (in-tree built-ins, then external plugin dirs)
#   - the TRUST policy           (which external drivers the user opted into)
# Each axis facade enumerates `<base>/<axis>/...` itself and gates externals with
# agmsg_driver_is_trusted.
#
# Search bases, in priority order (later overrides earlier among ELIGIBLE ones):
#   1. <root>/scripts/drivers          in-tree built-ins — always trusted
#   2. <root>/plugins                  default external plugin dir (install_dir/plugins)
#   3. each dir in $AGMSG_PLUGIN_DIRS   ':'-separated extra external dirs
#
# SECURITY: external drivers are shell code that runs with the user's privileges.
# They are NEVER loaded unless explicitly opted into (`agmsg plugin trust`), so an
# unexpected drop-in cannot execute. An untrusted external driver that is present
# is ignored (a built-in of the same name still resolves); callers may warn.
#
# Safe under `set -u`: every env read is guarded.

# Resolve THIS lib's dir at source time (robust to later subshell/relative cwd).
