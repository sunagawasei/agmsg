#
# A Claude Code `session_id` is NOT unique across parallel
# `claude --continue` / `--resume` processes (#93): the second process re-fires
# SessionStart with the *original* session_id, so two live processes claim to
# be the same session. Keying watcher/lock state (pidfile, watermark, actas
# owner) on session_id alone makes those two processes collide — most visibly
# the watch.sh "kill the previous holder for this session" logic (#66) turns
# into a mutual kill loop.
#
# We disambiguate by composing the session_id with the enclosing agent process
# pid, which IS unique per live process. The resulting "instance id":
#   - is stable across /clear within one agent process (sid + pid unchanged),
#     so the #66 dedup-on-relaunch still works;
#   - differs between parallel resume processes (different pid), so their
#     pidfile / watermark / actas owner stop colliding.
#
# Token shape:
#   "<session_id>.<pid>"   composite — pid is the enclosing agent process
#   "<session_id>"         bare — fallback when the agent pid can't be resolved
#                          (detached watcher, sandboxed ps, non-agent wrapper)
#
# session_ids are UUIDs / "agmsg-<...>" / "unknown-<pid>" — none contain a '.',
# so "last dot-segment is numeric" unambiguously marks the composite form.

# Cross-platform pid liveness check, and the ONLY one any shipped script should
# use. A bare `kill -0 "$pid" 2>/dev/null` is not a liveness check: it answers
# "can I signal this", and the two differ exactly where it matters.
#
# Git Bash's kill(1) only sees MSYS2/Cygwin PIDs; native Windows processes
# (Claude Code, etc.) are invisible to it, so kill -0 always returns false for
# them (#134). On Windows we fall back to tasklist.exe, which queries the native
# process table.
#
# Everywhere else, saying "dead" requires kill(2) and ps to agree. A failed
# `kill -0` is ESRCH (dead) or EPERM (alive, but not signalable by us — a
# sandbox does exactly this). Reading only the exit status reports a live
# process as gone, which is how a running watcher or bridge gets printed as a
# stale pidfile, how a live lock owner gets its lock reclaimed out from under
# it, and how a second app-server gets started beside the first.
# True iff <value> is a plain positive decimal pid, i.e. a value that names one
# process when handed to kill(1).
#
# Digits-only is NOT enough. `kill -0 0` does not ask about pid 0 — 0 means "the
# caller's own process group" — so it succeeds, and a caller that then runs
# `kill "$pid"` TERMs the whole group, itself included. A corrupt or hostile
# pidfile holding 0 is all it takes. A leading zero is rejected for a related
# reason: nothing here writes one, and kill(1) may read it as octal, so it names
# an unpredictable process.
#
# Patterns only, never `$(( ))`: arithmetic evaluation runs its argument.
#
# Split out from _agmsg_pid_alive so a caller that kills a recorded pid WITHOUT
# asking about liveness first can still refuse the values that do not name one
# process.
# A ceiling may be passed as $2 to override the platform's. Which one is right is
# a property of what the value will be USED for, not of the host -- see the call
# in _agmsg_pid_alive_local, which hands the value to kill(1) even on Windows.

# comment).
#
# #970's first attempt at this queried `ps -l -p PID` (pid-filtered) instead
# -- the same primitive compat_get_ppid/_compat_get_winpid already use for a
# LIVE pid, but never measured against a DEAD one before this. Measured live
# on real Windows Git Bash (2026-09-23): a dead pid makes `ps -l -p` exit 1,
# header line and all -- so requiring rc=0 before trusting absence (#954's
# own rule, correctly applied) made the dead case UNREACHABLE, permanently.
# The Windows CI hang this was meant to close never actually closed, because
# the query could never satisfy its own proof condition.
#
# The fix is the query, not the rule. `ps -l` with NO -p filter behaves like
# the POSIX `ps -Ao` snapshot: it exits 0 and lists every process, including
# our own -- so the SAME canary technique applies. Measured header (real
# Windows Git Bash, 2026-09-23): `PID PPID PGID WINPID TTY UID STIME
# COMMAND` -- PID is the list's own first column ordinarily; WINPID is a
# different number (the native Windows pid) and must never be read here. No
# process-state column exists in this shape, so unlike the POSIX branch
# above, a zombie cannot be told apart from a live process here -- out of
# scope for what #970 needs (a genuinely-exited pid, which the CI hang could
# never detect at all).
#
# review: Cygwin/MSYS `ps -l` documents an optional single-character state
# flag (S/I/O) that some rows -- not all, and not reflected in the header at
# all -- get PREPENDED as an extra leading field, pushing PID to the second
# column on exactly those rows. Reading column 1 unconditionally means a
# flagged row's real PID is never matched: an unflagged self row still
# proves the canary, so a flagged but genuinely LIVE target row reads as
# "absent" -- a live process misread as dead, #954's own failure shape.
# Fixed-width reading was considered and rejected: the flag is not a
# declared column at all, so there is no header position to key a fixed
# width on; detecting the flag value itself is the only thing that is
# actually documented.
#
#   - ps fails (rc != 0)                => UNKNOWN => caller reads as alive.
#   - rc = 0, but no row's PID field is our own $$ => the listing cannot be
#     trusted as complete (same canary logic as the POSIX branch) =>
#     UNKNOWN => alive.
#   - rc = 0, our own row present, target's row absent => positive proof of
#     death.
