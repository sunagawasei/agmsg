# actas-lock.sh — per-(team, agent) exclusivity locks.
#
# Background: agmsg supports a project being registered with multiple agent
# identities of the same type (claude-code/codex/...). Without ownership
# tracking, every concurrent CC session in that project would subscribe to
# every registered identity's messages — duplicate delivery, confused mark-
# read semantics, and the `actas` "exclusive role" model breaking down.
#
# This file implements a small filesystem-based ownership protocol:
#
#   Lock file: $SKILL_DIR/run/actas.<team>__<agent>.session
#   Content  : one line — the owner session_id.
#
# A session_id is alive iff some $SKILL_DIR/run/cc-instance.<pid> file
# currently contains it AND that PID is alive. The same primitive used by
# session-start.sh's orphan-watcher cleanup. Stale locks (owner is no
# longer alive) are reclaimable.
#
# Atomic claim is implemented via `ln` of a per-call tmp file. POSIX
# guarantees the link target either appears or doesn't, even under
# concurrent claim attempts.
#
# Required caller-set variable:
#   SKILL_DIR — agmsg skill root.

# --- #1023: run files are keyed by name, and two names can collide ------------
#
# `_actas_lock_encode` percent-encodes what a name is made of, but the `__`
# JOINING team and agent is not itself escaped -- so a team or agent name that
# legally CONTAINS `__` produces the same three paths for two different
# members: actas_lock_path("a__b","c") == actas_lock_path("a","b__c"). No
# separator fixes this on its own (`-` and `:` are equally legal in a name);
# the fix is to stop joining names at all where a stable id already exists.
#
# roster-journal.sh already maintains one: config.json's `team_id`, and a
# journal-derived `member_id` per (team, name). Both are UUIDs from a fixed
# alphabet, so `<team_id>__<member_id>` cannot suffer this collision -- no
# encoding scheme is needed for it.
#
# NOT EVERY TEAM HAS ONE. A team created before ids existed, that has never
# gone through `remote.sh`'s connect (which mints them), has no team_id --
# and, measured on this tree, a NEW member joining such a team today still
# gets no member_id either (join.sh's id-bearing branch never runs, because it
# is gated on the team already having one). There is deliberately no local
# minting path added here: for an id-less team, `_agmsg_id_key_for` returns
# nothing, and the three functions below fall back to the ORIGINAL
# name-encoded path, unconditionally -- the #1023 collision is not fixed for
# such a team, and that is a decided scope cut (#1023's follow-up), not a bug.
#
# FOR AN ID-BEARING TEAM, existing run files predate this change and are
# still name-keyed on disk. So the three path functions do not simply return
# the id-based path: each checks for a file already there under the id key,
# then a file under the legacy name key, and only when NEITHER exists does it
# hand back the id-based path -- which is where the NEXT write lands. A file
# already served under the old key keeps being served there until it is
# naturally replaced (a lock released and re-claimed, a placement rewritten);
# there is no bulk conversion and no caller anywhere needs to know which key
# it got. This is the same three-way "check, don't guess" shape the rest of
# this file already uses for the lock's own three-valued read.
# The `[ -f "$config" ]` and `[ -n "$team_id" ]` guards below are each
# measured REDUNDANT with the final `[ -n "$member_id" ]` one: removing config
# and team_id together still produces zero reds, because a missing config or
# empty team_id both lead to no roster journal existing, which
# agmsg_roster_name_owner already answers with an empty member_id -- caught by
# the one check that is load-bearing on its own (confirmed separately: removing
# only the member_id check reddens). Kept for clarity at each step rather than
# relying on a guard three calls away, same as #1152's measured-redundant
# empty-comm checks in agent-detect.sh.
# rc 0: printed the resolved key.
# rc 1: NO id for this team/agent -- decided (#1023's own scope cut for a
#       team with no team_id, or a member the roster never minted an id for).
#       Safe for a caller to fall back to the legacy name-keyed path.
# rc 2: UNDETERMINED -- could not even try to resolve one, so this says
#       NOTHING about whether an id exists. An unset SKILL_DIR is the only
#       cause today. This is NOT safe to treat as "no id": an id-keyed lock
#       could already exist on disk, and a caller that falls back anyway
#       would create a second lock at the legacy path for the same member --
#       exactly the double-lock _agmsg_id_or_legacy_path's own "MAIN defense"

#
# Review finding: a caller must never see BOTH files exist for the same
# member and get a resolution with no signal, and a resolution alone is not
# enough of a signal -- a warning-and-still-succeed form was tried and
# rejected on review: it still let a caller (claim, in particular) proceed as
# though it held sole ownership while an old-version reader could still honor
# the other file, and several callers of the three path functions discard
# stderr, so the warning was not even reliably seen. Refusing here instead
# does ripple the "always succeeds" contract of the three functions below to
# their callers (the trade explicitly accepted on review) -- but this state
# is reachable only by two writers racing across a version boundary onto a
# pair with no prior file at all (the MAIN defense above already means an
# UPGRADE alone, with an existing legacy file, never reaches here), so the
# callers reached are the ones a genuine double-claim must fail closed for.
