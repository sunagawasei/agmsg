# self-name.sh — a seat names its own pane when it ACTS, if it is not named.
#
# The problem (1.3.0 requirement): every live seat's terminal id/name must be
# right in any state. Identifying a seat from the outside cannot reach every
# state -- a seat started by hand has no placement record, a resumed seat's
# record points at a pane it no longer sits in -- so `team --fix` skips
# exactly the seats that need it. Inverting the direction removes the
# question: the seat itself knows its team, its name and (from its environment)
# the pane it is in, so when it does anything through agmsg it can make sure
# its pane carries its name. The moment such a seat sends or reads, it is
# correct, whatever the records say.
#
# The self-naming primitive already existed (agmsg_terminal_name_self), but
# every one of its five callers was a Claude Code path (SessionStart,
# actas-claim, join, watch, check-inbox), so a codex seat never passed
# through it. This hook is tied to the ACTION instead, and is called from the
# commands a seat of any type runs: send, inbox, history. The five paths stay;
# they and this hook call the same primitive and leave the same mark, so
# whichever runs first, the state is the same.
#
# COST is the condition (measured 2026-09-08 on the shared workstation):
#   history.sh 0.8-1.1 s, inbox.sh 0.2-0.3 s   the commands this rides on
#   mark check (one file read + compare)         0.22 ms
#   naming (one terminal round trip)            10-30 ms, tmux or herdr
# So the common case costs nothing anyone can see, and the terminal is called
# once per (seat, pane, server generation).
#
# THE MARK LIES in two ways, and this is what is done about each:
#   - the pane was closed and another seat now sits in it: that seat has no
#     mark for this pane (its own record names another pane, or nothing), so
#     it names the pane for itself on its first action, overwriting the stale
#     name. The old seat, if it acts again from elsewhere, finds its mark
#     naming a pane it is not in, and names the new one.
#   - the terminal server restarted and forgot the name: the mark carries the
#     server generation as the environment shows it (tmux: the pid in $TMUX;
#     herdr: the socket file's inode+ctime, recreated at server start), so a
#     restart makes the mark not match and the seat names itself again.
#   - the name was removed while the server generation and the pane are
#     unchanged (someone renamed the pane by hand, or a terminal that clears
#     names without restarting): the fast half asks the pane which agmsg label
#     it carries, so the missing name IS seen and the seat names itself again.
#     This was a stated BLIND SPOT until #1130 -- nothing in the environment
#     changes, so a check that only read the environment could not know -- and
#     it is closed by the same read that closed the bigger one below.
#   - the environment is not this seat's at all: a seat whose commands run
#     under a shared app-server inherits the daemon's pane, so the environment,
#     and the mark and record written from it, all agree on somebody else's
#     pane. That seat is perfectly self-consistent and used to short-circuit
#     forever (#1130, measured: eleven hours of acting, the record never
#     moved). The same read catches it, because the daemon's pane carries the
#     daemon owner's label, not this seat's.
#
# Never fails the caller: naming is a side effect of the action, the action is
# the thing. Every failure path returns 0 after one line on stderr.

# Does the pane the ENVIRONMENT names actually carry this seat's label? (#1130)
#
# The fast half exists to skip work when everything is already in place, and it
# decided that from the mark, the record and the environment. All three can agree
# and all three can be WRONG together: a seat whose commands run under a shared
# app-server inherits the daemon's pane, so the environment answers with somebody
# else's pane; whatever was written from that answer -- the mark, the record --
# agrees with it by construction. Such a seat is perfectly self-consistent and
# short-circuits forever. Measured on this fleet: a seat's record and mark both
# named another seat's pane and had not moved in eleven hours of that seat acting,
# because the hook returned here every single time. The label path added in #1112
# sits in the slow half and was never reached.
#
# So the short-circuit is no longer keyed only on the input it was built to
# distrust. This asks the pane itself, through the per-pane read the confirmation
# in #1112 uses: if the environment's pane carries this seat's label, the
# environment agreed with something that is not the environment and the skip is
# earned. If it carries someone else's label, or none, or cannot be read, it is
# not -- and the slow half runs, where the label resolves the right pane.
#
# It costs one per-pane query on the FAST path only (it is the last condition, so
# a seat that already has work to do pays nothing extra). Measured on this
# machine: `herdr pane get` 25 ms, against 71 ms for the `pane list` a full
# re-resolution would cost; tmux answers `display-message` on a local socket.
# That is the price of not trusting a value we decided not to trust.
#
# Any answer other than "carries my label" is a reason to do the work, INCLUDING
# an unreadable one: a read that failed is not a pane that matched, and treating
# it as one is the fold this codebase keeps paying for.
