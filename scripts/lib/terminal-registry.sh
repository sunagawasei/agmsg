# Terminal registry — the "terminals" driver axis facade.
#
# A terminal driver abstracts the ONE terminal multiplexer a member's CLI runs
# under: tmux, herdr, or plain (no addressable pane). It absorbs the terminal
# operations that were scattered as inline `$TMUX`/`HERDR_*` branches across
# spawn.sh / despawn.sh / watch.sh, behind one contract, and adds peek/poke.
#
# Layout mirrors the types axis (ADR 0002, docs/spec/driver-interface.md):
#   scripts/drivers/terminals/<name>/terminal.conf   read-only key=value DATA
#   scripts/drivers/terminals/<name>/ops.sh          sourced bash, terminal_* fns
# Discovery + trust come from driver-registry.sh (built-ins always trusted,
# externals opt-in). This facade only knows the terminals-axis layout.
#
# Contract (per docs/spec/driver-interface.md §1). Every driver's ops.sh exposes:
#   terminal_check                      control op: deps -> ok|missing_deps(+DIRECTIVE)
#   terminal_describe [project]         exit 0, key=value only (name/backend/capabilities)
#   terminal_detect <session_id>        RECORD op: print this session's own terminal id and
#                                       exit 0 IFF we are running under this terminal now;
#                                       non-zero (no stdout) otherwise. herdr resolves the
#                                       pane from the session id (NOT inherited env);
#                                       tmux uses $TMUX_PANE; plain is the exit-0 fallback
#                                       printing '-' (no addressable pane).
#   terminal_spawn <name> <project> <target> <boot...>   RECORD op: create a pane/window,
#                                       launch boot, print its addressable terminal id.
#   terminal_despawn <id>               control op: kill the pane/window named by <id>.
#   terminal_peek <id> [--lines N]      RECORD op: print pane text verbatim (NOT parsed).
#                                       With --lines, request scrollback depth N; shipped
#                                       pane drivers pass N unchanged to their backend.
#                                       unsupported -> exit 13, reason on stderr.
#   terminal_poke <id> <text>           control op: send text and submit. unsupported -> 13.
#   terminal_pane_state <id>            READ ONLY: is that pane still there?
#                                       Prints gone / present / unknown and
#                                       returns 0 for a settled answer, 13 when
#                                       this terminal has no addressable pane to
#                                       ask about, 10 when it could not be
#                                       reached. "Could not ask" never returns 0:
#                                       a caller deletes the placement record on
#                                       `gone` alone, and `terminal_despawn`
#                                       cannot answer this (it collapses "already
#                                       closed" and "could not close" into 13).
#   terminal_where <id>                 READ op: print the id's container (tmux window /
#                                       herdr tab). Existence is not answered here;
#                                       a missing id is unknown/10, never `gone`.
#   terminal_arrange <source-id> <intent> <target-id>
#                                       control op: declaratively place source below/right
#                                       of target. Prints moved / unchanged. It reads layout
#                                       before mutating because the native moves are not
#                                       idempotent. Ambiguous layout -> token + non-zero.
#   terminal_name <id> <team> <name> [mode]
#                                       control op: set the pane's names; idempotent.
#                                       Two names, not one: the label a person
#                                       reads and the key the TERMINAL addresses
#                                       the agent by in its own namespace. This
#                                       repo's peek/poke resolve through the
#                                       placement record, not the key.
#                                       `mode=key` sets only the key
#                                       (AGMSG_TERMINAL_NAMING=off); absent sets
#                                       both. A driver that has only one name
#                                       treats it as the key.
#                                       (safe to re-apply on SessionStart).

# WHAT A DRIVER MAY ASSUME ABOUT THE SHELL IT IS CALLED IN (#1129)
#
# Every entry point that reaches a driver runs `set -euo pipefail` -- join.sh,
# actas-claim.sh, watch.sh, session-start.sh, inbox.sh, send.sh, history.sh,
# check-inbox.sh. Drivers are sourced INTO those processes, so a driver function
# runs under those options whether or not it wants to. Three consequences, and
# they are requirements, not advice:
#
#   1. NEVER read a variable you did not set without a default. `${TMUX}` and
#      `${TMUX%%,*}` are fatal under `-u` when the variable is unset. Write
#      `${TMUX:-}`, or open the function with `[ -n "${TMUX:-}" ] || return 10`
#      and refuse -- which is what `terminal_detect` has always done.
#
#   2. A fatal read inside `$( )` kills only that subshell, and callers here
#      routinely write `x="$(op ... 2>/dev/null)" || continue`. So the failure
#      arrives as "this driver had nothing to say", with the reason discarded.
#      That is how #1126 shipped: the tmux label search died on an unset $TMUX
#      and self-identification silently fell back to the environment -- the
#      answer the label path exists to replace.
#
#   3. THE TEST SUITE CANNOT CATCH THIS, so do not read a green suite as a
#      promise. `tests/test_helper.bash` sets no shell options, and the tests
#      call driver functions in the bats shell rather than through the entry
#      points. Measured (#1129): forcing `set -u` into the shared helper and
#      running all 102 suites produced 8 reds, none of them a defect in
#      `scripts/`; and on the tree that still contained #1126 the relevant suite
#      was 129/129 GREEN. The guard for this class is static and lives in
#      `.github/scripts/check-unguarded-env-reads.sh`.
#
# The full terminal ABI. EVERY driver must define EVERY one of these; the loader
# verifies it. Naming the set here (not relying on each driver being complete) is
# what makes a missing op FAIL rather than silently borrow the previously loaded
# driver's same-named function.

# --- name THIS pane, and record where it is ---------------------------------
#
# The step that makes peek/poke reach a member nobody spawned: join, actas and
# SessionStart all call it, so a pane a human opened by hand is as addressable as
# a spawned one. Limiting peek/poke to spawned members was refused (fujibee,
# 2026-08-28); this is what lifts the limit. SessionStart is not optional — herdr
# drops an agent's name when the agent exits, so a resume must re-apply it.
#
# Three outcomes, deliberately kept apart:
#
#   named    the terminal can name a pane AND this pane was identified, so the
#            driver names it. A "<terminal>:<id>" placement record -- the same one
#            spawn writes -- follows ONLY when the caller asked for one; see the
#            6th argument.
#   skipped  the terminal has no `name` capability (plain has no addressable
#            pane). QUIET, 0, and NO record: a permanent property of the terminal
#            is not news on every join, and a record whose id cannot be acted on
#            is not a placement -- writing one is a bug in the writer (ruling,
#            2026-08-31).
#   unnamed  the terminal CAN name, A SESSION ID WAS GIVEN, and this pane still
#            could not be identified. non-zero, reason already on stderr from the
#            resolver: saying "cannot name this pane" beats naming nothing.
#
# The session id qualifies `unnamed` on purpose. Called WITHOUT one -- join has
# none to give, there being no per-type datum saying which env var carries it --
# a terminal that needs it is `skipped`, not `unnamed`. No input is a different
# fact from a failed lookup, and reporting the first as the second would warn on
# every join under herdr about a condition nobody can act on.
#
# Callers treat non-zero as a WARNING, never as a failure of the join/claim/
# session-start they are performing. Naming is additive; it must not change what
# those commands do or return.
#
# The 6th argument decides whether a PLACEMENT RECORD is written, and it defaults
# to NOT writing one. Naming a pane and being the authoritative placement for a
# seat are different claims: `join` names a pane but proves nothing about who
# holds the seat -- the same identity can be joined from a second session while a
# first one holds it through actas -- so a record written there would redirect
# peek/poke/despawn at a pane that does not have the seat. Only a caller with
# positive evidence of ownership passes `record`: actas (it went through the
# claim) and SessionStart (the seat is resolved). The default is the safe half, so
# a caller added later that has not thought about it cannot silently take a
# placement over.
#
#   agmsg_terminal_name_self <session_id> <team> <agent> <project> <type> [record]
# Which OTHER seat's placement record already claims this pane reference, if any.
# Prints "<team>__<agent>" as the record file spells it (percent-encoded, the form
# on disk) and nothing when the pane is unclaimed.
#
# PLACEMENT GUARD (#1114, guarding the regression #1111 exposed). Written as a
# stop-gap for #1112; #1112 has landed and this stays as the SECOND line: label-
# first resolution makes a wrong answer less likely, not impossible (a label can
# be duplicated, cleared, or stale, and the environment fallback is still the
# shared daemon's for codex), so a pane another seat's record already claims is
# still refused here. Removing it is a separate decision, taken only when label
# resolution is made authoritative; the seam tests pin the two mechanisms
# together until then.
#
# "Other seat" means a record that is not THIS agent's in any existing team.
# run/ is flat and one seat registered in two teams has two records
# (spawn.<team1>__<x>, spawn.<team2>__<x>) for the same pane; the second must not
# be blocked by the first, or a seat that acts in its second team can never be
# recorded there (measured on this host, where every seat is in two teams).
# "This agent's" is decided by building the record path for each team on disk
# with the same encoder and comparing whole file names -- "__" is legal inside
# a name, so the file name cannot be cut at a separator. The one state this
# cannot resolve: this agent's own record under a team that has since vanished
# from teams/ -- no path can be built for it, so it reads as a rival and blocks
# this seat (fail-closed). The refusal message says so and names the file to
# remove; a team that is dropped with its run/ records left behind is that state.
#
# Since #1111 a seat records its own placement when it acts, resolving the pane
# from its OWN environment. For codex that environment is not its own: those
# seats arrive through one shared app-server daemon, so every seat under it
# inherits the daemon's pane (measured: three codex seats all resolve
# herdr:w1:p2, while they actually sit at w1:p2, w1:pN and w1:pP). Their records
# are correct today only because spawn wrote them from outside; the next action
# each one takes overwrites its own record with the daemon's pane, one seat at a
# time.
#
# So until the environment is fixed, a seat does not take a pane another seat's
# record already claims. This is first-writer-wins, which is NOT always right --
# a stale record from a dead seat will squat a pane that a live seat has taken
# over. #1112 (label-first resolution) is the fix for the shared environment,
# and this guard is not replaced by it: a label makes a wrong answer less likely,
# not impossible, so the arbitration stays. The cost of the squat is one action
# and a message naming the file; the cost of no guard is another seat's pane.
# Split a placement ref into terminal / pane id / socket, so two refs can be
# compared as PANES rather than as strings. Sets _AGMSG_PS_TERM, _AGMSG_PS_ID and
# _AGMSG_PS_SOCK (empty when the ref carries no socket); non-zero for a ref it
# cannot parse.
#
# String equality is not enough: the record format still accepts the legacy
# socket-less tmux forms (`%N`, `@N`) alongside `tmux:<socket>:%N` (see the
# scheme comment above and agmsg_terminal_ref_terminal), so a peer record holding
# `%1` never matches a freshly composed `tmux:/tmp/x:%1` -- and the guard waves
# the write through for exactly the records most likely to be OLD, which are the
# ones most likely to belong to somebody else.
#
# The scheme table below mirrors agmsg_terminal_ref_terminal / agmsg_terminal_ref_id
# (inline, so the scan forks nothing per record); a test pins that the two agree
# on every form the record format accepts.

#   the session id     herdr's agent_session for those panes does not match the
#                      thread actually running there -- measured on the same
#                      three seats, and it returns the SAME wrong pane.
#
# Two independent roads to one wrong answer is not a coincidence; both read the
# process tree, and for these seats the process tree is not where they live. The
# label is not read from the process tree: it was written on one pane at a time.
#
# That is the whole of the claim, and it is deliberately smaller than "the label
# is correct". The label is written by `spawn`, repaired by `team --fix` and
# written by seats naming themselves -- the same machinery whose wrong answers
# this exists to route around. So a wrong label is possible, and preferring it
# is a bet that a per-pane write is wrong less often than a value inherited by
# every process under one daemon. Not authority: a more recent observation, from
# a source that at least distinguishes one pane from another.
#
# EXACTLY ONE, or nothing. The label is not unique by construction -- it is
# usable only WHEN it is unique, which is a different claim and the one the code
# makes.
#
# Zero matches is the ordinary bootstrap state (nothing has named this seat yet).
# Two or more is not hypothetical: measured on a real tmux server, two panes
# carried the same `@agmsg_agent`, both alive, one running a CLI and one a bare
# shell -- and splitting a labelled pane does NOT copy the option (measured on a
# dedicated server), so a duplicate is something agmsg itself wrote. Picking the
# first would choose silently between panes, one of which is someone else's --
# the failure this whole change exists to stop, re-introduced one layer up. Both
# fall through.

#   <kind>:<driver id>, where every driver's id is itself <instance>:<pane>:
#     herdr:/run/jugemu.sock:w1:p7      instance = the server's socket path

#     plain:iterm:/dev/ttys040          instance = the emulator adapter name
#
# Pane ids repeat across instances (two herdr sessions both own a w1:p2; tmux
# has one id space per socket), so a pane id alone can name a live pane in
# another instance -- measured 2026-09-11 when a repair resolved in one session
# landed in another's pane. A locator carries the instance, and every reader
# of one goes through the SAME driver-level split (_agmsg_terminal_id_split,
# below _agmsg_placement_split and agmsg_locator_compose's own round-trip
# check): one grammar per kind, held once, in the driver that owns it.
#
# The registry owns the outer shape (kind + id) and asks the KIND's driver for
# the boundary inside its id (`terminal_id_split`): where a herdr id ends in
# two colon fields and a tmux or plain id in one is the driver's grammar, held
# once, in the driver. An instance may contain spaces. Herdr instances
# containing a colon use the registry's versioned encoding (`v2:` plus percent
# escapes), so an older reader sees an invalid qualified id and refuses it

# Every pane every terminal can see, as (kind, instance, pane) TRIPLES.
#
# A BARE PANE ID IS NOT AN ADDRESS. Measured on this machine, 2026-09-11: two
# herdr instances were running, and enumerating both produced 52 rows in which
# `w1:p1`, `w1:p2`, `w1:p4`, `w1:p5` and `w1:p7` each appeared TWICE -- the same
# id naming a different pane, and a different team's seat, in each instance. The
# tmux side has had the same property since #1051 (`%0` exists on every server).
# So nothing here ever emits a pane id on its own; the instance travels with it,
# and the instance is the value that makes the row answerable again -- a socket
# path, not a display name.
#
# THREE ROW KINDS, because three things happen and collapsing any two of them
# loses the one that matters:
#
#   <kind><TAB><instance><TAB><pane>   a pane was observed there
#   !<TAB><kind><TAB><instance>        that instance could not be read
#   !!<TAB><kind>                      that terminal's INSTANCE LIST could not be
#                                      read, so no instance can even be named
#   ?<TAB><kind>                       that terminal cannot enumerate at all
#
# FOUR CAUSES, FOUR ROWS, and none of them folded. `?` is a CONFIGURATION in
# which the question has no answer and a caller can stop asking. `!` is one hole
# in an otherwise good answer. `!!` is a terminal we could not open at all --
# which looks identical to `?` from the outside and is the opposite instruction
# to a caller (retry, not give up). Collapsing any pair of these is how "we could
# not look" becomes "there is nobody there", which is the failure this whole
# sweep exists to avoid.
#
# rc is 0 whenever the walk itself ran. A caller decides what to do about `!` and
# `?` rows; this function does not decide for it.
