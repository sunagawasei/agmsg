# watch-stuck-map.sh -- per-pair "stuck cursor" tracker for the delivery watcher
# (#1045 fix 2). Kept in its own file so the map operations can be unit-tested
# directly: watch.sh runs on source, so its inline helpers could only ever be
# exercised through a timing-dependent end-to-end test, and on a shared host a
# poll-cycle count cannot be hit deterministically (see #1045 review notes).
#
# Data structure: one record per tracked pair, records separated by NEWLINE,
# fields within a record separated by US (\x1f): "<pair><US><cursor><US><count>".
# The record separator must be a byte that cannot occur inside a field. A newline
# is one we already rely on -- the watcher reads its subscription set one
# tab-separated pair per LINE, so a team or agent name cannot contain a newline;
# US is a control byte names never carry. An earlier version joined records with
# a SPACE and scanned them with `for e in $STUCK_MAP`, which word-splits a name
# like "team a" across two words so its record never matches -- the count then
# resets every cycle and the guard this exists to provide NEVER fires. Records
# are therefore read a whole line at a time and fields split on US only, never by
# shell word splitting. The functions operate on the caller's STUCK_MAP global in
# place (no subshell) so they add no fork to the watcher's poll loop.

# Decide whether the watcher should serve (team=$1, agent=$2) this cycle, given

# to one of:
#   serve       -- free/ours and the team's store exists: deliver this cycle
#   held:<sid>  -- another session holds it (broad watcher): SKIP
#   nostore     -- the team's store does not exist yet: SKIP
# and returns 0. On EITHER skip verdict it has already dropped the pair's stuck
# tracker via _stuck_drop, because a cycle this watcher does not observe is not a
# consecutive stall -- a resumed pair must start a fresh count or a healthy
# watcher would trip the guard on the first cycle back.
#
# The drop lives HERE, inside the skip decision, on purpose: the two are one
# operation. Earlier the drop was a separate statement at each `continue`, so a
# refactor could delete it and every test stayed green -- the property was at the
# call sites, not in a tested contract. Now removing the drop reddens this
# function's unit test, and removing the call reddens the held/no-store behavior
# tests. It must NOT run in a `$(...)`: _stuck_drop mutates the STUCK_MAP global,
# which a command-substitution subshell would discard -- hence the verdict is
# returned in PAIR_VERDICT, not on stdout. The caller handles the actas-fatal
# case (a dedicated watcher that lost its only role EXITS) before calling this,
# and does the once-per-transition logging keyed on the verdict.
