# resolve-project.sh — resolve an agent SESSION's real project root from a
# possibly-misleading invocation pwd. See #92.
#
# Background: agmsg slash commands pass "$(pwd)" as the project key. When the
# user cd's into a subdirectory (or a git worktree) of the project the agent
# session actually lives in, that pwd no longer matches the registered project,
# so lookups silently miss and phantom registrations get created under a fresh
# alias tied to the subdir.
#
# Two complementary signals recover the real root, NEITHER needing a stable
# session_id (Codex slash commands don't expose one — docs/actas.md):
#
#   1. A per-process marker written at SessionStart, keyed by the enclosing
#      agent process PID:  run/proj.<agent_pid>.project = <real root>
#      Works for claude-code and codex alike — both have a process we can walk
#      to via the ppid chain, and a slash command runs as a child of it.
#   2. Ancestor walk: the nearest ancestor of pwd that is a registered project
#      for this type. Git-independent (handles worktrees, non-git trees), and
#      covers Codex / non-hook invocations where no marker was written.
#
# Resolution order: marker -> ancestor -> pwd. The pwd fallback is unchanged
# behavior, so direct shell invocations and genuinely-unrelated directories
# keep working as before. Set AGMSG_RESOLVE_PROJECT=0 to force the raw pwd:
# used by spawn.sh, which passes an explicit, not-yet-registered --project that
# must never be rewritten to the spawning session's own project.

# an arm matched against "claude codex",
# so agmsg_pid_is_agent accepted an enclosing Claude Code process as, say, a

# marker, and a cursor member's project resolved to the project of whoever was
# asking. reset.sh, handed a correct path, looked for the registration under
# the caller's project and reported "No registrations removed" while it sat in
# the roster.
#
# Names must also be type-distinctive: do not add `agent` to any arm below.
# the Cursor CLI installer uses that basename (#856), and matching it would
# attach the wrong pid (#93) -- the alias is an intentional miss, on the

# itself inside a command substitution can read the result as a plain

# `binaries=$(_agmsg_agent_binaries "$type")` -- that `$( )` forks a subshell
# for the WHOLE function body, so the cache write a few lines below
# (`printf -v "$cache_var" ...`) landed in that subshell's memory and was
# gone the moment it exited. Every single call re-ran the grep+head below:
# measured, 5 calls for the same type cost 5 greps and 5 heads, not 1 (the
