# herdr terminal driver — a pane inside a herdr session.
#
# Sourced by the terminals registry into the caller's context. terminal_* only,
# no set -e/-u.
#
# FACT BOUNDARY — what is measured vs still asserted (keep this honest):
#   MEASURED on the real machine (2026-08-29; and live on
#   a real workstation, herdr 0.8.0, 2026-09-02/03 — the resolver run against the real
#   `agent list`, with positive controls):
#     - `herdr agent list` is JSON; agent_session in the list is an OBJECT and the
#       session id is at .value (inherited HERDR_PANE_ID is NOT trusted).
#     - a session-less pane has the agent_session KEY ABSENT entirely; no live-list
#       entry carries a JSON-null agent_session. B recognizes it by STRUCTURE, not by
#       a value or a key-name set — both drift while the pane lives (agent_status
#       changes; name/display_agent come and go): the agent_session key is absent, the
#       pane_id is valid, the fixed identity anchor (agent/terminal_id/tab_id/
#       workspace_id, measured always-present, 0 variance over 11 panes, 2026-09-04)
#       is present, and NO field is object/array-valued (so a session moved to a renamed
#       OBJECT/ARRAY key cannot pass; a session FLATTENED to a scalar is an unidentifiable
#       residual — the cost of allowing unknown scalar extensions, named at the det CTE).
#       display_agent was a string in one 2026-09-04 agent list; a NAMED bare pane was not
#       observed by 2026-09-04 (its control is defensive).
#     - the pane-id grammar (w1:p4, w1:pB, w5:p3, w1:pC).
#     - `pane read --source <visible|recent|...>` (the --source values were measured live).
#     - the internal agent-name key is a collision-resistant SHA-256 derivation of
#       (team, agent) — see _herdr_internal_key for why concatenation/folding has a
#       structural collision.
#     - the existing spawn/despawn calls (pane split/run, tab create, pane close).
#   ASSERTED, NOT yet measured against a live call: `herdr agent prompt`'s argv for
#     poke and `herdr agent rename`'s argv for the internal name key (no agent-rename
#     call in main to measure against). These stay flagged inline and in the PR body;
#     the fixtures pin the control flow and the argv THIS driver emits, so a real-CLI
#     mismatch is a localized one-line fix.

# requirement 1 (herdr pre-input readiness). Before typing the boot into the pane's
# shell, confirm the shell is AT ITS PROMPT — nothing else in the foreground — so a
# startup program (e.g. an oh-my-zsh update prompt) cannot eat the first keystroke.
# The signal is STRUCTURAL and environment-independent (2026-09-04): herdr's
# pane process-info reports shell_pid and foreground_process_group_id, and the shell is
# at its prompt IFF the foreground process group IS the shell itself. No prompt string
# is matched (zsh/bash/Windows alike) and no point-in-time value is baked in.
#
# Why not the obvious herdr calls (all MEASURED 2026-09-04, recorded so nobody re-hunts):
#   - herdr agent start takes only a --kind enum, NOT an arbitrary boot script, and our
#     spawn runs a boot script, so it cannot replace pane run.
#   - herdr agent wait waits for an AGENT state; a pane with no agent yet is not in
#     agent list (30 panes vs 11 agent-list entries), so it cannot see a bare shell.
#   - agent list has no shell-readiness field; process-info is the one that does.
#
# NECESSARY, NOT SUFFICIENT (kept honest): this proves "no OTHER command is
# running". It does NOT prove the keystroke survives — if the SHELL ITSELF is reading
# (an oh-my-zsh "[Y/n]" has no child process), process-info returns equal and this
# reports READY. That case was UNMEASURED as of 2026-09-04. So a first keystroke can
# still be lost; that residual is caught AFTER typing by the readiness handshake /
# launched-unconfirmed, never here. Do not read this gate as a guarantee.
#
# THREE outcomes, kept distinct (the positive-validation contract):
#   0 READY      — command ok, BOTH ids present and canonical positive integers, EQUAL.
#   1 NOT READY  — both ids validated the SAME way, and UNEQUAL (a foreground process).
#   2 UNKNOWN    — the command failed, a field is missing, or a value is not a canonical
#                  positive integer. "" == "" / null == null / same-malformed are NOT
#                  ready: equality is read ONLY after both values pass validation. A
#                  nonexistent pane and a malformed pane id return the SAME error, so

# rename` clobber another member's addressing. FOLDING or CONCATENATING with any
# literal separator has a STRUCTURAL (deterministic, reachable) collision, because
# that separator can itself appear in a name (agmsg only forbids . / \ " [ ] control
# chars and a leading '-', so ':', '-' and '_' are all legal in team AND agent
# names):
#     ("a-b","c") and ("a","b-c")   both fold to  a-b-c
#     ("a:b","c") and ("a","b:c")   both join to  a:b:c   (the `<team>:<agent>` form too)
# We DERIVE instead: 'a' + the first 24 hex (96 bits) of SHA-256 of the pair. The
# pair is joined with a NEWLINE, a control char FORBIDDEN in both names
# (scripts/lib/validate.sh rejects [[:cntrl:]]), so the PREIMAGE encoding is
# unambiguous — this removes the structural '-'/':' ambiguity above. It is NOT
# mathematically injective: any hash of arbitrary-length input into 96 bits has
# collisions by pigeonhole. It is COLLISION-RESISTANT, which is what this needs:
# herdr requires a unique name only AMONG LIVE agents (scope Naming), a population
# of dozens in this store — 96 bits against dozens is far more than enough. A true
# no-collision guarantee would need a persistent map + collision detection (storage
# + migration), which is out of v1's scope. RECOVERY BOUNDARY on the vanishing
# chance of a collision: terminal_name's `herdr agent rename` fails, and that is
# non-fatal — the pane id in the placement record still resolves peek/poke.
#
# 'a' + 24 hex = 25 chars, leading letter, all within the regex. Uses the store's

# <mode> is `key` or absent. Absent means both names; `key` means the resolvable
# one only, and the caller has already decided that (the registry reads the env
# var, so the policy lives in one place and this only carries it out).
#
# Which of the two is which matters: `pane rename` is the label a person reads,
# `agent rename` is the name herdr itself addresses the agent by, in its own
# namespace — NOT what this repo's `peek`/`poke` resolve through, which is the
# placement record's pane id. So under `key` that name is still established and
# only the decoration is skipped —
# and a key that cannot be set is an error there, because nothing else happened.
# Which panes carry this agmsg label? One pane id per line; no match prints
# nothing and still returns 0.
#
# `herdr pane list` returns every pane WITH its label in one call (measured: 38
# panes, label present on each named one, null on the unnamed), so this needs no
# per-pane round trip.
#
# This exists because neither of the other two ways to answer "which pane am I"

# not in its pane, so the inherited HERDR_PANE_ID is the daemon's pane and all of
# them resolve the same one; and herdr's own agent_session for those panes does
# not match the thread actually running there. The label depends on neither -- it
# was written per pane rather than inherited by a process.
#
# Which is a claim about its FAILURE MODE, not about its truth: the label is

  # THE KEY FIRST, and its failure is fatal.
  #
  # The reason is NOT that peek/poke resolve through the key — an earlier
  # revision of this comment said so and it is false in this tree: those commands
  # resolve through the placement record's pane id, and `_herdr_internal_key` is
  # read nowhere outside this driver. The key is the name herdr knows the agent
  # by, on its side.
  #
  # The reason that survives is the one below: the caller writes the placement
  # record only when this returns 0. Ordering the label first meant a failed
  # DECORATION returned 13 before the key was attempted and before the record was
  # written, so a member ended up with neither name and no record — the
  # requirement this driver serves broke through that door. tmux has always had
  # this order; herdr was the one driver that put the ornament in front.
  # Two DIFFERENT failures used to leave the same word and nothing else (#1127):
  # the key could not be COMPUTED, and the server refused to APPLY it. Both
  # printed `runtime_error` with herdr's own stderr thrown away, so a naming
  # failure on a live seat could not be attributed to either -- measured on this
  # fleet, where a seat's record was repaired in the same action that failed to
  # name, and the message said only `(runtime_error)`.
  #
  # The token on stdout stays `runtime_error`: it is the driver contract and
  # callers read it. What changes is that the REASON is no longer discarded --
  # the pattern this file already uses elsewhere, a line on stderr naming which
  # step failed, and for the server call the server's own words with it.

# OPTIONAL OP. Observe ONE candidate pane's process facts, as a strict record.
# Contract and vocabulary: see the tmux driver's copy of this op and
# scripts/lib/self-proof.sh. This op never classifies -- a failure is a non-zero
# exit, and the coordinator turns that into `undetermined`, never a negative.
#
# stdout, on rc 0, exactly one line:
#
#   <pane-id><TAB><pid>[<TAB><pid>…]
#
# THE RESPONSE IS CHECKED TO BE ABOUT THE PANE WE ASKED FOR. `process_info`
# carries its own `pane_id`, so an answer about a different pane is detectable
# and is treated as no answer -- the same rule the tmux op's identity canary
# enforces, for the same reason: this fact decides whether a seat may write into
# a pane.
#
# EVERY VALUE IS TYPE-CHECKED BEFORE IT IS READ. A pid that arrives as the JSON
# string "123" extracts as 123 and would pass a digit test, but a pid that came
# as a string is not a validated pid -- so `json_type` is asked first, in the
# same payload, exactly as _herdr_pane_input_ready does (#1051 review).
#
# A BAD ELEMENT FAILS THE WHOLE OBSERVATION. An earlier revision skipped entries
# it could not read and returned whatever was left, which is a PARTIAL set
# wearing the shape of a complete one -- and if the entry it skipped was the
# owner's process, the coordinator would answer `disproved` about a pane the seat
# is actually in. So the count of entries is compared against the count of
# entries that yielded a valid pid, and a mismatch is no answer at all. (Review:
# this is the same failure the pure classifier refuses for a malformed row.)

# OPTIONAL OP. Every pane this terminal can see, ACROSS EVERY INSTANCE, each row
# carrying the instance it was seen in. Contract: see the tmux driver's copy.
#
# WHY THIS OP HAS TO EXIST FOR HERDR TOO, and what it cost to find out. A herdr
# pane id is unique within ONE instance and nowhere else. Measured on this
# machine, with two instances running:
#
#   instance   response pane_id   shell_pid   who is actually there
#   jugemu     w1:p7              2727        one team's seat
#   oma        w1:p7              80649       a different team's seat
#
# BOTH answer `pane_id=w1:p7`. So an id echoed back by the server proves the
# server answered about the id we asked for -- never that the instance we meant
# answered. Every row here is qualified with the SOCKET it came from, which is
# the value that makes the row answerable again, exactly as the tmux driver
# qualifies with its socket.
#
#   <instance><TAB><pane>    a pane observed in that instance
#   !<TAB><instance>         that instance could NOT be read
#
# `session list --json` reports `running` per session, so a session declared not
# running is SKIPPED -- that is a decided fact, not a gap. A running session
# whose pane list fails is the gap, and it gets a named row rather than being
# dropped: without it the sweep would read "nobody is there" for an instance
# nobody could open.
#
# AN ENTRY WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND FAILS THE WHOLE ENUMERATION, as in
# terminal_pane_process_observe: `running` must be a JSON boolean and
# `socket_path` a JSON string, checked by type in the query itself, and the
# number of entries is compared against the number that passed. A session we
# could not parse might be the one holding the pane the caller is looking for.
