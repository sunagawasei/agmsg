# control op: name the pane. The RESOLVABLE key is a pane user option
# @agmsg_agent = <team>:<agent> (scope Naming: tmux is never targeted by name —
# '-t a:b' is session:window to tmux — so peek/poke scan @agmsg_agent instead).
# select-pane -T sets the human-visible title as a copy. Canonical separator is
# ':' (both team and agent commonly contain '-'). Idempotent (safe to re-apply on
# SessionStart).
# <mode> is `key` or absent — see the herdr driver for the split. Here the
# `@agmsg_agent` pane option is the resolvable one and the window name / pane
# title is the decoration, so `key` sets the option and stops.
# Which panes carry this agmsg label? One id per line, socket-qualified like every
# other id this driver hands out; no match prints nothing and still returns 0.
#
# The label is not AUTHORITATIVE -- it is a more recent observation than the
# alternatives, and that is a weaker claim on purpose. `spawn` writes it, `team
# --fix` repairs it, and a seat writes it for itself: it is written by the very
# machinery that is producing wrong answers, so a wrong label is possible and
# nothing here can rule one out.
#
# What it is not is INHERITED. A seat resolves its own pane from $TMUX_PANE, and
# for an agent whose commands run somewhere other than its pane -- codex, through
# one shared app-server -- that answer belongs to whoever started the daemon, so
# every seat under it resolves the same pane, confidently and identically
# (#1112). `@agmsg_agent` was set on the pane that was actually named, one pane
# at a time, so asking the server who carries the label asks about a value that
# was written per pane rather than one that was copied into a process.
#
# One call, and the whole server: `-a` so a seat in another session still finds
# itself. Nothing is filtered by the caller's own $TMUX_PANE on purpose -- that
# is the value under suspicion.
#
# THE ID GOES FIRST and the row is split at the FIRST separator, because only the
# id is constrained. `validate.sh` is a deny-list of path/JSON hazards and '|' is
# deliberately not among them, so `team|alice` is a legal pair and its label
# carries a '|' (#1122 review). A trailing label read as "everything after the
# first separator" survives that; `-F '|'` and field 2 does not -- it would take
# `team` and call it the whole label, matching a pane that carries a DIFFERENT
# label whose first segment happens to agree. A pane id is `%<n>`/`@<n>` and can
# never contain the separator, so putting it in front makes the split exact for
# every label, not for the ones without a '|' in them.
#
# (A label containing a NEWLINE would still split the row itself. That one is
# closed upstream: `validate.sh` rejects control characters in both halves of the
# pair, which is why the separator is the only case left to handle here.)

#
# The confirmation half of `terminal_find_by_label`: the listing above is a
# filter, and a filter that is too loose hands back somebody else's pane with
# nothing in the count to notice. This asks the server about the single pane the
# listing chose, through a DIFFERENT query (`display-message -t <id>` rather than
# `list-panes -a`), so a wrong answer has to be wrong twice.
#
# Why this op exists rather than reading `terminal_team_observe`: the label does
# not live in the same observation field for every driver. tmux has no pane-label
# field of its own, so it publishes the pair as the KEY (`@agmsg_agent`) and its
# label field is a constant `n/a:no_independent_field`; herdr has a real pane
# label and its key is a hash. Reading a fixed field position therefore asks the
# two drivers different questions -- and asked of tmux, a question whose answer
# can never equal the label. That is not hypothetical: it shipped in the first
# revision of #1112 and made the tmux label path fail its confirmation every
# time, silently, while the herdr tests stayed green (#1122 review).
#
# Same identity canary as `terminal_team_observe`, for the same reason: the id
# names a pane on the server the ref points at, and reading a same-numbered pane

# importantly -- the rule for when a server counts as DEAD were already written
# and measured there; that PR was closed only because a different design was
# expected to replace it, and that expectation is gone. The mechanics below are
# that branch's, unchanged in substance.
#
# WHY A PANE ID ALONE IS NOT AN ANSWER. A pane id is unique within one server and
# nowhere else: `%0` exists on every server that has ever opened a pane (#1051).
# So every row here is qualified with the socket it came from, and a caller can
# never end up holding an id it cannot ask about again.
#
# stdout, one line per record:
#
#   <instance><TAB><pane>    a pane observed in that instance
#   !<TAB><instance>         that instance could NOT be read
#
# THE SECOND ROW IS THE POINT, and it is where this differs from #1146's search.
# That search asked "is this label unique across every server?", so a server it
# could not read POISONED the whole answer -- it returned "could not answer"
# rather than risk reporting one hit while a second hit sat unread. This op asks
# a different question ("what is out there?"), and for that question one
# unreadable server must not lose the panes of the servers that did answer. So
# the hole is NAMED and enumeration continues. Same mechanics, different verdict,
# because the question is different.
#
# A SOCKET PROVES NOTHING. It outlives the server that made it. Only tmux saying
# `no server running` or `no such file or directory` is evidence of death;
# permission, a transient failure and a protocol mismatch all look identical from
# here, and treating those as death would silently drop a live server's panes.

  # errexit defect review found in the proof coordinator, arriving through a
  # glob option instead: the caller's shell state reaching into a sourced file.
  #
  # A command substitution is its own subshell, so `shopt` inside it cannot leak
  # back to the caller -- which is the only way to get a predictable glob without
  # editing a setting that is not ours. Control bytes are refused rather than
  # carried: every row here is TAB-separated and a socket name is not a place to
  # smuggle one.
  # TWO THINGS, and each was measured wrong first:
  #
  #   `shopt -u failglob`  nullglob does NOT cover this. With both set, failglob
