name: __SKILL_NAME__
description: Cross-agent messaging via SQLite. Send messages between Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Grok Build, and other agents. No daemon, no network, no dependencies beyond bash and sqlite3.
---

Agent messaging command. **IMPORTANT: Always use the provided scripts. NEVER directly read or edit config files, DB, or team data. There is NO register.sh — use join.sh to join a team.**

**Shell requirement:** All agmsg scripts are Bash scripts. Always execute them via `bash`, never via PowerShell or cmd directly. If your default shell is not Bash (e.g. PowerShell on Windows), wrap every command with `bash -lc '...'`. Example: `bash -lc '~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/send.sh myteam alice bob "hello"'`. Do NOT construct DB paths manually — the scripts handle path resolution internally. If you need to redirect storage, use `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH` (the supported override).

## Identity

If you already know your AGENT and TEAMS from a previous `/__SKILL_NAME__` call in this session, skip to **Execute** below.

Otherwise, run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/whoami.sh "$(pwd)" grok-build`

Four possible outputs:

**A) Single identity:**
`agent=<name> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=grok-build project=<path>`
→ Remember AGENT and TEAMS, then go to **Execute**.

**B) Multiple identities:**
`multiple=true agents=<n1,n2,...> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=grok-build project=<path>`
→ Ask the user which agent name to use for this session, then go to **Execute**.

**C) Not in a team:**
`not_joined=true available_teams=<t1,t2,...>` (or `available_teams=none`)
→ Show the user the available teams from the output, then:

  > **First-time setup required.**
  > Joining a team so this agent can send and receive messages.
  > - **Team name**: a group of agents that can message each other (available: <list from output>)
  > - **Agent name**: this agent's identity within the team

  1. Ask: "Enter a team name (joins existing or creates new)"
  2. If the team name given already appears in `available_teams`, run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/team.sh <team>` to see the current roster (name, type, project) and note the names already in use. Look for a naming convention already in play (e.g. a shared base name with role/number suffixes like `aggie-cc1`/`aggie-cc2`, or names derived from the team name) and, when one exists, propose 2-3 unused names that extend it; otherwise propose 2-3 short, distinctive identity names (not a bare tool-type label like `codex`/`cc`). Either way, names must not collide with the roster. Then ask: "Enter a name for this agent (suggestions: <name1>, <name2>, <name3> — or type your own)". For a brand-new team, skip the roster check and just ask: "Enter a name for this agent".
  3. **You MUST use join.sh** — run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/join.sh <team> <agent_name> grok-build "$(pwd)"`
  4. Show the result and explain:

  > **Joined!** You can now use `/__SKILL_NAME__` to check and send messages.
  > - `/__SKILL_NAME__` — check inbox
  > - `/__SKILL_NAME__ send <agent> <message>` — send a message
  > - `/__SKILL_NAME__ team` — list team members
  > - `/__SKILL_NAME__ history` — message history

  5. **REQUIRED — Do NOT skip this step.** Ask the user to pick a delivery mode using exactly this prompt:

     ```
     Choose delivery mode for incoming messages:

       1) turn    — Check inbox at the end of each assistant turn
                     A .grok/rules/agmsg.md rule has you self-check inbox.sh
                     each turn. Zero setup; no background watcher.

       2) monitor — Real-time push via the `monitor` tool (BETA)
                     Launches watch.sh through the `monitor` tool (NOT
                     run_terminal_command); each new message streams in as a
                     notification. You launch it explicitly (Grok hooks can't
                     auto-start it at SessionStart). BETA: still stabilizing —
                     turn mode is the stable default.

       3) off     — No automatic delivery
                     Manual /__SKILL_NAME__ only.

     [1]:
     ```

     - **Wait for the user's answer before proceeding.** Empty input means `1` (turn).
     - Map the chosen number to a mode (`1`→`turn`, `2`→`monitor`, `3`→`off`) and run:
       `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set <mode> grok-build "$(pwd)"`
     - If you chose `monitor`, tell the user it is a **BETA** that is still stabilizing (turn mode is the stable default). Then read the `AGMSG-DIRECTIVE` block that `delivery.sh` prints and follow it now: invoke the `monitor` tool with the given `command` / `description` / `persistent: true` so the watcher starts streaming into this session. `both` is not supported.

  6. Then check inbox for the newly joined team.

**D) Suggestions for reuse:**
`suggest=true agents=<n1,n2,...> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=grok-build project=<path> available_teams=<t1,t2,...>`
→ No exact registration exists for this project, but there are same-type agent names registered elsewhere.

  1. Show the suggested agent names to the user.
  2. Ask whether to reuse one of those names or choose a new one.
  3. Ask for the team name to join (existing or new).
  4. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/join.sh <team> <agent_name> grok-build "$(pwd)"`
  5. Then continue with the normal post-join flow above.

## Execute

**Only use scripts in `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/` — do not read or modify files under `teams/` or `db/` directly.**

**Ensure the monitor is running first (monitor mode only).** If the project's delivery mode is `monitor` (check via `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh status grok-build "$(pwd)"`) and no `agmsg inbox stream` watcher is running in this session yet, invoke the `monitor` tool now (before the subcommand below):

- command: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/watch.sh "${GROK_SESSION_ID:--}" "$(pwd)" grok-build`
- description: `agmsg inbox stream`
- persistent: true

Pass the `command` to the `monitor` tool **exactly as written** — do **not** append `| head`, `| tail`, any other pipe, or a redirection. Each watcher line is one message; a closed downstream pipe (e.g. `head` exiting after N lines) makes the watcher's writes fail and messages after the Nth are dropped silently.

Launch it with the **`monitor` tool only** — **never** `run_terminal_command` (with or without `background: true`) and **never** a hand-rolled `tail -f` of a log. Only the `monitor` tool surfaces the stream into this conversation; a terminal/background launch writes to a log you never see, so messages keep arriving but you silently miss them (and stray watcher tasks pile up). After launching, confirm a live `monitor` task named `agmsg inbox stream` exists; if you don't see one (e.g. you launched it as a terminal/background command by mistake), stop that and relaunch via the `monitor` tool.

Each output line is one message: `<ts> | <team> | <from> -> <to> | <body>`. React to messages as they arrive; reply with `send.sh`. Launch it only once — if a watcher is already streaming, do not start a second one. In `turn`/`off` mode there is no watcher; skip this.

**If no arguments provided (DEFAULT action — always do this when the command is invoked without arguments):**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** run inbox check for each TEAM: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/inbox.sh $TEAM $AGENT`
2. Do NOT ask the user what to do — just run the inbox check.
3. If there are messages, read and respond appropriately. To reply:
   `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/send.sh $TEAM $AGENT <to_agent> "<message>"`

If argument is "history":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/history.sh $TEAM $AGENT`

If argument starts with "team list" (e.g. "team list", "team list --json", "team list --scope project"):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/team-list.sh <the rest of the args after "team list", unchanged>`
2. This is a distinct command from bare "team" below — check for "team list" FIRST so "list" is never mistaken for a team name.

If argument is "team":
1. For each TEAM, run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/team.sh $TEAM`

If argument starts with "send" (e.g. "send misaki check the server"):
1. Parse target agent and message from the arguments
2. Determine which team the target agent belongs to, then run:
   `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/send.sh $TEAM $AGENT <to_agent> "<message>"`

If argument is "config":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/config.sh show`
2. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "config set" (e.g. "config set hook.check_interval 30"):
1. Parse key and value from the arguments.
2. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/config.sh set <key> <value>`


If argument starts with "actas" followed by an agent name (e.g. "actas alice"):
1. Parse the new role name. If none was given (e.g. bare "actas", or the user asks you to suggest one), run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/team.sh <team>` for each TEAM to see the current roster. Look for a naming convention already in play (e.g. a shared base name with role/number suffixes like `aggie-cc1`/`aggie-cc2`, or names derived from the team name) and, when one exists, propose 2-3 unused names that extend it; otherwise propose 2-3 short, distinctive identity names (not a bare tool-type label). Either way, names must not collide with the roster. Ask the user to pick one or type their own before continuing.
2. Run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/identities.sh "$(pwd)" grok-build` to see whether the role is already registered for this (project, type).
3. If the name does not appear in the output, join under the existing team. For a single team, run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/join.sh <team> <name> grok-build "$(pwd)"`. For multiple teams, ask the user which team to join the new role into.
4. **If delivery mode is `monitor`**, switch the watcher to the new role so receive is restricted to it:
   a. If an `agmsg inbox stream` watcher is already running in this session, stop it with `kill_command_or_subagent` on its task id.
   b. Launch a fresh watcher with the `monitor` tool (persistent):
      - command: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/watch.sh "${GROK_SESSION_ID:--}" "$(pwd)" grok-build <name>`
      - description: `agmsg inbox stream`
   The 4th argument restricts the subscription to messages addressed to `<name>` only. In `turn`/`off` mode there is no watcher to switch — skip this step.
5. Set the session's active FROM to `<name>` for every `send.sh` call until another `actas`.
6. Tell the user: "Now acting as `<name>`. Sends use `<name>` as from. In monitor mode, receive is restricted to `<name>`; in turn/off mode receive still covers all your registered roles."

If argument starts with "drop" followed by an agent name (e.g. "drop alice"):
1. Parse the role name.
2. Run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/reset.sh "$(pwd)" grok-build <name>` to remove that role's registration.
3. If the session's active FROM was `<name>`, clear that state.
4. **If delivery mode is `monitor`** and an `agmsg inbox stream` watcher is running in this session, stop it with `kill_command_or_subagent`, then relaunch it with the `monitor` tool using the default (no 4th arg) subscription so receive covers the project's remaining roles:
   - command: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/watch.sh "${GROK_SESSION_ID:--}" "$(pwd)" grok-build`
   - description: `agmsg inbox stream`
   - persistent: true
5. Tell the user: "Dropped role `<name>` from this project."

If argument is "mode" (no further args):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh status grok-build "$(pwd)"`
2. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "mode" followed by a mode name (e.g. "mode turn"):
1. Parse the mode. Grok Build supports `turn`, `monitor`, and `off` — reject `both` with: "Grok Build does not support `both`; use `turn`, `monitor`, or `off`."
2. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set <mode> grok-build "$(pwd)"`
3. If the mode is `monitor`, read the `AGMSG-DIRECTIVE` block `delivery.sh` prints and follow it: invoke the `monitor` tool with the given command so the watcher starts in this session. If the mode is `turn` or `off` and a watcher is streaming, stop it with `kill_command_or_subagent`.

If argument is "hook on" (legacy alias):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set turn grok-build "$(pwd)"`
2. Tell the user: "Delivery mode set to 'turn' (legacy hook on behavior)."

If argument is "hook off" (legacy alias):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set off grok-build "$(pwd)"`
2. Tell the user: "Delivery mode set to 'off'."

If argument is "reset":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/reset.sh "$(pwd)" grok-build`
2. Tell the user the result.

If argument starts with "rename" but not "rename-team":
1. Accept only an explicit user request. Parse either `<team> <old_name> <new_name>`, or `<old_name> <new_name>` only when this agent belongs to exactly one team.
2. Never invent either name. Before execution, repeat the resolved team, old name, and new name and ask the user to confirm. Wait for confirmation.
3. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/rename.sh <team> <old_name> <new_name>`
4. Show the result. For a connected team, the `member_renamed` journal event propagates the rename to other machines.

If argument starts with "rename-team":
1. Accept only an explicit user request. Parse `<old_team> <new_team>`.
2. Never invent either team name. Before execution, repeat the old and new team names and ask the user to confirm. Wait for confirmation.
3. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/rename-team.sh <old_team> <new_team>`
4. Show the result.

If argument starts with "remote connect":
1. Parse the required `--endpoint <url>` and `<team>`, plus optional `--e2ee`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh connect --endpoint <url> [--e2ee] <team>`
3. Show the output to the user. Plain sync is the default; pass `--e2ee` only when the user explicitly requests end-to-end encryption. The choice is fixed by the first connect.
4. End by showing this copy-paste command for the other machine, with the actual endpoint and team substituted: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh pull --endpoint <actual-url> <actual-team>`

If argument starts with "remote pull":
1. Use this command whenever the user asks to bring in a team that already exists on a server. Never use `join.sh` for that request.
2. Parse the required `--endpoint <url>` and `<team>`, plus optional `--team-id <uuid>`.
3. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh pull --endpoint <url> [--team-id <uuid>] <team>`
4. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "remote unlock":
1. Parse `<team>`, one or more `--snapshot <file>` arguments in ascending revision order, exactly one of `--identity <file>` or `--identity-stdin`, and optional `--confirm-digest <sha256>`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh unlock <team> --snapshot <file> [--snapshot <file> ...] (--identity <file>|--identity-stdin) [--confirm-digest <sha256>]`
3. The snapshot digest must be compared over a separate live channel. Never infer or auto-confirm it. Raw identity material is a permanent secret; when `--identity-stdin` is needed, tell the user to run the command in their own terminal rather than asking them to paste the identity into agent chat.
4. Show the complete result, including the imported-envelope count and engine PID.

If argument starts with "remote status":
1. Parse an optional `<team>` and `--json`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh status [<team>] [--json]`
3. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "remote sync start":
1. Parse the required `<team>`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh sync start <team>`
3. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "remote disconnect":
1. Parse the required `<team>`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh disconnect <team>`
3. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "remote forget":
1. Parse the required `<team>`. This permanently deletes that team's local roster, history, keys, trust, and sync state, but never changes the server.
2. Do not add `--yes` yourself. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh forget <team>`
3. The command requires the user to confirm in their terminal. If this agent has no interactive terminal, show the deletion summary and tell the user to rerun the displayed command directly; never bypass confirmation for them.

If argument starts with "key generate" followed by an optional team name:
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/key.sh generate [<team>]`
2. Show the full output to the user, including the mandatory key-backup notice — do not summarize it away.

If argument starts with "key show":
1. Parse an optional team name and `--reveal-secret`.
2. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/key.sh show [<team>] [--reveal-secret]`
3. `--reveal-secret` requires a real interactive terminal and is refused in agent mode — if the user wants to reveal a secret, tell them to run it themselves directly in their own terminal rather than through you.
4. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "key import" followed by a team name:
1. **Do not ask the user to paste the private identity into this chat, and do not run this command yourself.** This identity is a permanent secret. Tell the user to run this directly in their own terminal:
   ```
   read -rsp 'Identity: ' IDENTITY; echo
   printf '%s' "$IDENTITY" | ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/key.sh import <team> --identity-stdin
   unset IDENTITY
   ```
2. Ask them to paste back only the command's output (never the identity itself) once it's done.
3. **No advanced/automation env-var path is offered for key import** — not even a pre-existing, before-session variable. An identity file is a permanent secret; always use the human-in-own-terminal flow above.

`key rotate` and device-pairing `key request`/`key approve` are not available yet (they refuse unconditionally and change no state) — if the user asks for either, tell them so rather than attempting to run them.
