# #1254: one Codex app-server per SEAT, never shared across seats. This file
# is the shared vocabulary every piece that touches a seat-keyed app-server
# record uses -- the key's grammar, the record's shape, and the two things
# ever done with a record: read it to find the seat's server, or stop it.
#
# Two separate identities, deliberately not one (design review):
#   - The SEAT KEY only has to be UNIQUE, so file names never collide. It is
#     "$$.<unix-time>.<RANDOM>", generated once by codex-monitor.sh before it
#     forks anything, and travels from there via AGMSG_CODEX_SEAT_KEY (set on
#     the app-server's own command and exported into the monitor's own shell,
#     so both the app-server's children and the exec'd TUI inherit it). It is
#     NEVER recomputed by a reader -- Windows cannot read a process's start
#     time via `ps`, so nothing here may depend on being able to.
#   - The record's pid/witness/cmdline triple is what STOPPING checks. A seat
#     key alone is not proof of identity; the record is.
#
# Every seat key this file's functions accept -- freshly generated or read
# back from AGMSG_CODEX_SEAT_KEY -- is validated against the same fixed,
# filename-safe grammar before it is ever used to build a path. A caller that
# skips the check could turn an inherited or corrupted env value into a path
# traversal or a collision with an unrelated file; refusing is the whole
# point of having a grammar at all.

# 0 if <key> is digits-and-dots only (no leading/trailing/doubled dot, no
# empty segment), a bounded length, and non-empty. This is the ENTIRE
# grammar: nothing else about a seat key is ever trusted before it is used
# to build a run/ path.
