# codex-record-session.sh — record a codex role's resumable session (#339).
#
# claude-code records (team,agent)->session in actas-claim.sh. Codex actas is
# otherwise send-side only and never runs actas-claim, so without this a codex
# role would have no role-session record and could never be resumed (spawn would
# always boot it fresh). This is the codex-side equivalent: the codex actas flow
# calls it, and it writes the record so a later spawn/resume brings the role back
# into its thread.
#
# Usage: codex-record-session.sh <team> <agent> [project]
#
# <project> is optional and defaults to this script's own $PWD. The default is
# codex-specific and deliberate: on Windows codex's shell_command tool runs
# through PowerShell, so a "$(pwd)"/"$PWD" argument in the calling prompt is
# expanded -- or mangled: an escaped-double-quote form (\"$PWD\") collapses to
# a lone `\` -- by PowerShell BEFORE bash ever sees it, and the model's quoting
# choice is not controllable. This script itself always runs under bash in the
# session's working directory, so its own $PWD is deterministically the correct
# POSIX form. Other types must keep passing project explicitly -- they don't
# share codex's shell_command cwd guarantee.
#
# Thread-id resolution — QUALITY GUARD (#339 review). The recorded id MUST be
# THIS session's codex thread, never another's: a resume mis-fire (resuming the
# wrong conversation) is worse than a fresh boot. So resolution is deliberately
# conservative and biased toward recording NOTHING when unsure (fresh = zero harm):
#   1. Prefer $CODEX_THREAD_ID -- exported on the interactive/--remote path, which
#      is exactly the spawned-codex case this feature targets. Unambiguous.
#   2. Else fall back to a rollout whose session_meta cwd matches the project, but
#      ONLY when that match is UNIQUE among recent rollouts. If two or more recent
#      rollouts share this cwd (concurrent codex sessions in the same directory),
#      we cannot tell which is ours -> record nothing.
# Always best-effort: every failure path is a silent no-op (exit 0).
