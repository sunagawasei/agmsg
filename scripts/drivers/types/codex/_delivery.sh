# codex keeps the default JSON event-hooks apply (agmsg_delivery_apply); it adds
# enable/disable side effects (print the monitor shim setup on enable, stop the
# bridge on disable) and replaces the runtime status summary with Codex bridge
# liveness. Sourced into delivery.sh's context, so SKILL_DIR, SCRIPT_DIR,
# RUN_DIR, agmsg_resolve_node, CODEX_MONITOR_DOC_URL and stop_codex_bridge are
# in scope.
# Args (both hooks): on_enable <mode> <type> <project>; on_disable <type> <project>.

  # it says nothing about whether `codex` on PATH actually reaches the shim
  # right now. A PATH-based install (codex-shim-install.sh install, or a raw
  # symlink) that loses to the real Codex binary in PATH order launches
  # completely unmonitored sessions with no other signal at all. See #387/#397.
  #
  # This is inherently a best-effort hint, not a diagnosis: the shim FILE
  # existing at $HOME/.agents/bin/codex does NOT mean this install relies on
  # PATH resolution for it. The shell-function method (on_enable's primary
  # recommendation) is the common case, and having the PATH shim file ALSO
  # present alongside it is normal, not contradictory -- a function takes
  # priority over PATH in an interactive shell regardless of what's on PATH,
  # and a fresh non-interactive `command -v codex` here never sees that
  # function at all, so it can look like a "mismatch" on a perfectly healthy,
  # function-routed setup. Found in real-machine testing after the first cut
  # of this check warned unconditionally on exactly that combination.
  #
  # So: only surface this note when the PATH shim file exists AND resolves
  # to something else AND no bridge for this project has ever come alive
  # (weak but non-alarmist corroboration -- a live/previously-live bridge
  # means SOMETHING is routing correctly already, by whichever method).
  # Phrased as a conditional hint, not an assertion of brokenness.
