  # here is a start token that reads and DIFFERS: the pid now hosts another process,
  # so the one we killed is gone. Everything else keeps waiting -- a token that reads
  # UNCHANGED (still alive), and, deliberately, a token we could NOT read (which
  # proves nothing: /proc or ps can fail transiently). We do NOT consult
  # _agmsg_pid_alive_local: its false is not a trustworthy absence proof -- a
  # transient ps failure there returns "gone" (missing pipefail, #954), the exact
  # observation-as-state trap this loop exists to avoid. So a normal exit falls
  # through to the timeout and returns 1: we do NOT spawn this pass, so a bridge
  # still holding the thread as writer is never double-started (#935). The cost is
