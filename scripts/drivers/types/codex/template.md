name: __SKILL_NAME__
description: Cross-agent messaging via SQLite. Send messages between Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and other agents. No daemon, no network, no dependencies beyond bash and sqlite3.
---

Agent messaging command. **IMPORTANT: Always use the provided scripts. NEVER directly read or edit config files, DB, or team data. There is NO register.sh — use join.sh to join a team.**

**Shell requirement:** All agmsg scripts are Bash scripts. Always execute them via `bash`, never via PowerShell or cmd directly. If your default shell is not Bash (e.g. PowerShell on Windows), wrap every command with `bash -lc '...'`. Example: `bash -lc '~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/send.sh myteam alice bob "hello"'`. Always single-quote the `bash -lc` payload; NEVER use a double-quoted wrapper with escaped inner quotes (e.g. `bash -lc "... \"$PWD\" ..."`) — PowerShell parses `\"` as a literal backslash that terminates the string, silently corrupting the command and dropping everything after it. Do NOT construct DB paths manually — the scripts handle path resolution internally. If you need to redirect storage, use `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH` (the supported override).

## Identity

If you already know your AGENT and TEAMS from a previous `$__SKILL_NAME__` call in this session, skip to **Execute** below.

Otherwise, run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/whoami.sh "$(pwd)" codex`

**Windows PowerShell:** The Shell requirement above still applies, but a bare `bash` in PowerShell often resolves to the WSL shim. Invoke **Git Bash** explicitly and keep the entire `-lc` payload inside one PowerShell single-quoted string:

`& 'C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe' -lc '~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/whoami.sh "$(pwd)" codex'`

Do not use POSIX `'"'"'` quote splicing in PowerShell; it can leave the `-lc` payload unterminated. Windows PowerShell 5.1 strips the embedded double quotes when passing the payload, so `"$(pwd)"` arrives unquoted — fine unless the current directory contains spaces; prefer PowerShell 7.3+ if it does. If Git Bash is installed elsewhere, replace the executable path above with its actual path.

Four possible outputs:

**A) Single identity:**
`agent=<name> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=codex project=<path>`
→ Remember AGENT and TEAMS, then go to **Execute**.

**B) Multiple identities:**
`multiple=true agents=<n1,n2,...> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=codex project=<path>`
→ Ask the user which agent name to use for this session, then go to **Execute**.

**C) Not in a team:**
`not_joined=true available_teams=<t1,t2,...>` (or `available_teams=none`)
→ Show the user the available teams from the output, then:

  > **First-time setup required.**
  > Joining a team so this agent can send and receive messages.
  > - **Team name**: a group of agents that can message each other (available: <list from output>)
  > - **Agent name**: this agent's identity within the team

  1. Ask: "Enter a team name (joins existing or creates new)"
  2. If the team name given already appears in `available_teams`, run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/team.sh <team>` to see the current roster (name, type, project) and note the names already in use. Look for a naming convention already in play (e.g. a shared base name with role and number suffixes (`<base>-<role><n>`), or names derived from the team name) and, when one exists, propose 2-3 unused names that extend it; otherwise propose 2-3 short, distinctive identity names (not a bare tool-type label like `codex`/`cc`). Either way, names must not collide with the roster. Then ask: "Enter a name for this agent (suggestions: <name1>, <name2>, <name3> — or type your own)". For a brand-new team, skip the roster check and just ask: "Enter a name for this agent".
  3. **You MUST use join.sh** — run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/join.sh <team> <agent_name> codex "$(pwd)"`
  4. Show the result and explain:

  > **Joined!** You can now use `$__SKILL_NAME__` to check and send messages.
  > - `$__SKILL_NAME__` — check inbox
  > - `$__SKILL_NAME__ send <agent> <message>` — send a message
  > - `$__SKILL_NAME__ team` — list team members
  > - `$__SKILL_NAME__ history` — message history

  5. **REQUIRED — Do NOT skip this step.** Ask the user to pick a delivery mode using exactly this prompt:

     ```
     Choose delivery mode for incoming messages:

       1) monitor — Real-time push
                    Prints a `codex` shell function that routes launches through an
                    app-server bridge, so it changes how `codex` starts.
                    See docs/codex-monitor-beta.md.
                    Recommended.

       2) turn    — Check inbox at the end of each assistant turn
                    Stop hook pulls after each response.

       3) off     — No automatic delivery
                    Manual $__SKILL_NAME__ only.

     [1]:
     ```

     - **Wait for the user's answer before proceeding.** Empty input means `1` (monitor).
     - Map the chosen number to a mode (`1`→`monitor`, `2`→`turn`, `3`→`off`) and run:
       `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set <mode> codex "$(pwd)"`
     - If monitor is chosen, tell the user: "Codex monitor changes how `codex` starts — it prints a shell function to add to your shell profile. Add the printed function, restart the shell, then launch future sessions with normal `codex`. If you prefer a global PATH shim, run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/drivers/types/codex/codex-shim-install.sh install` and put `~/.agents/bin` first on PATH. You can also use `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/drivers/types/codex/codex-monitor.sh` for explicit monitor launches. The bridge starts on the **first turn** of a new Codex session (the SessionStart hook fires on your first message, not the moment Codex opens), so **restart your Codex session and send one message for monitor to take effect** — this already-running session stays unmonitored until it restarts. For more info: https://github.com/fujibee/agmsg/blob/main/docs/codex-monitor-beta.md"

  6. Then check inbox for the newly joined team.

**D) Suggestions for reuse:**
`suggest=true agents=<n1,n2,...> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=codex project=<path> available_teams=<t1,t2,...>`
→ No exact registration exists for this project, but there are same-type agent names registered elsewhere.

  1. Show the suggested agent names to the user.
  2. Ask whether to reuse one of those names or choose a new one.
  3. Ask for the team name to join (existing or new).
  4. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/join.sh <team> <agent_name> codex "$(pwd)"`
  5. Then continue with the normal post-join flow above.

## Execute

**Only use scripts in `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/` — do not read or modify files under `teams/` or `db/` directly.**

**If no arguments provided (DEFAULT action — always do this when the command is invoked without arguments):**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** run inbox check for each TEAM: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/inbox.sh $TEAM $AGENT`
2. Do NOT ask the user what to do — just run the inbox check.
3. If there are messages, read and respond appropriately. To reply:
   `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/send.sh $TEAM $AGENT <to_agent> "<message>"`

If argument is "history":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/history.sh $TEAM $AGENT`

If argument starts with "team list" (e.g. "team list", "team list --json", "team list --scope project"):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/team-list.sh <the rest of the args after "team list", unchanged>`
2. This is a distinct command from bare "team" below — check for "team list" FIRST so "list" is never mistaken for a team name.

If argument is "team":
1. For each TEAM, run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/team.sh $TEAM`

**send vs ask.** `send` is one-way (notifications, acks, fire-and-forget,
control) and returns immediately. `ask` is request/reply: it sends, then BLOCKS
until <to_agent> replies back to you, and prints the reply. Use `ask` when you
need an answer before continuing; use `send` when you do not expect a reply.

If argument starts with "send" (e.g. "send misaki check the server"):
1. Parse target agent and message from the arguments
2. Determine which team the target agent belongs to, then run:
   `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/send.sh $TEAM $AGENT <to_agent> "<message>"`

If argument starts with "ask" (e.g. "ask misaki does the server look healthy?"):
1. Parse target agent and message from the arguments.
2. Determine which team the target agent belongs to, then run:
   `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/send.sh $TEAM $AGENT <to_agent> "<message>" --wait [--timeout <sec>] [--interval <sec>]`
   (equivalently `dispatch.sh ... ask <to_agent> "<message>"`).
3. It blocks until <to_agent> replies, then prints `status=reply` + the reply
   line; on timeout it prints `status=timeout` and exits 2. Defaults:
   `--timeout 300 --interval 2`. It is id-scoped (waits for a reply newer than
   this send), needs no inbox draining, and does not mark anything read.

If argument is "config":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/config.sh show`
2. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "config set" (e.g. "config set hook.check_interval 30"):
1. Parse key and value from the arguments.
2. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/config.sh set <key> <value>`


If argument starts with "actas" followed by an agent name (e.g. "actas alice"):
1. Parse the new role name. If none was given (e.g. bare "actas", or the user asks you to suggest one), run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/team.sh <team>` for each TEAM to see the current roster. Look for a naming convention already in play (e.g. a shared base name with role and number suffixes (`<base>-<role><n>`), or names derived from the team name) and, when one exists, propose 2-3 unused names that extend it; otherwise propose 2-3 short, distinctive identity names (not a bare tool-type label). Either way, names must not collide with the roster. Ask the user to pick one or type their own before continuing.
2. Run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/identities.sh "$(pwd)" codex` to see whether the role is already registered for this (project, type).
3. If the name does not appear in the output, join under the existing team. For a single team, run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/join.sh <team> <name> codex "$(pwd)"`. For multiple teams, ask the user which team to join the new role into.
4. Set the session's active FROM to `<name>` for every `send.sh` call until another `actas`.
5. Record this session as the role's seat so it can be resumed later (best-effort): determine which team `<name>` belongs to (from the identities output / the join above), then run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/drivers/types/codex/codex-record-session.sh <team> <name>` (the script resolves the project directory itself). It writes the record only when this session's codex thread id is unambiguous; otherwise it records nothing and the role simply boots fresh next time (no harm). This is what lets a later `spawn <role>` bring the role back into this conversation.
6. Tell the user: "Now acting as `<name>`. Sends will use `<name>` as the from agent. In monitor mode, each role's incoming messages are routed only to that role's recorded Codex thread; roles without a recorded thread remain unread."

If argument starts with "drop" followed by an agent name (e.g. "drop alice"):
1. Parse the role name.
2. Run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/reset.sh "$(pwd)" codex <name>` to remove that role's registration.
3. If the session's active FROM was `<name>`, clear that state.
4. Tell the user: "Dropped role `<name>` from this project."

If argument starts with "spawn" (e.g. "spawn claude-code alice", "spawn codex reviewer --window"):
1. Parse `<type>` (any spawnable type — run `spawn.sh` with no args to list them; currently `claude-code`, `codex`, `cursor`, `grok-build`, `hermes`), `<name>`, and any options (`--project`, `--team`, `--window`, `--split h|v`, `--terminal`, `--no-wait`, `--ready-timeout <secs>`, and for headless-capable types (e.g. `codex`, `cursor`) `--headless` / `--interactive`).
2. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/spawn.sh <type> <name> --project "$(pwd)" [options]`
   - spawn.sh pre-joins `<name>`, then opens a tmux pane/window (when this session is inside tmux) or a new OS terminal, and launches the target CLI with `/__SKILL_NAME__ actas <name>` as its initial prompt.
   - By default it BLOCKS until a spawned claude-code agent's watcher attaches (`status=ready`); `status=timeout` + exit 3 if not ready within `--ready-timeout` (default 90s). `--no-wait` for fire-and-forget. Types with `monitor=no` (e.g. `codex`, `cursor`, `grok-build`) skip the wait (no awaitable readiness).
   - It refuses early if `<name>` is already held by another live session, if the target CLI is not installed, or if there is no tmux and no usable terminal (headless).
3. Show the script's output.

If argument starts with "despawn" (e.g. "despawn reviewer", "despawn alice --force"):
1. Parse `<name>` and any options (`--force`, `--timeout <secs>`). `despawn` is the inverse of `spawn` — it tears down a member you previously spawned.
2. Determine which team `<name>` belongs to (as with `send`), then run:
   `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/despawn.sh <team> $AGENT <name> [--force] [--timeout <secs>]`
   - Default (graceful): sends a `ctrl:despawn` control message to `<name>`. A claude-code member's watcher drops its own role and closes its own tmux pane, ending the agent. Blocks until the lock releases, up to `--timeout` (default 30s), then prints `status=ok`. On timeout it prints `status=timeout` and exits 3 — retry with `--force`. A codex member has no watcher to respond, so use `--force` for it.
   - `--force`: skips the message and tears the member down from the placement recorded at spawn time — kills its tmux pane/window and drops its registration.
3. Show the script's output.

If argument is "mode" (no further args):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh status codex "$(pwd)"`
2. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "mode" followed by a mode name (e.g. "mode monitor"):
1. Parse the mode. Codex supports `monitor` (app-server bridge), `turn`, and `off` — reject `both` with: "The Codex bridge supports `monitor`, `turn`, or `off`; `both` is not supported yet."
2. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set <mode> codex "$(pwd)"`
3. If mode is `monitor`, tell the user: "Codex monitor is enabled. Add the printed shell function to your shell profile, restart the shell, then launch future sessions with normal `codex`. If you prefer a global PATH shim, run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/drivers/types/codex/codex-shim-install.sh install` and put `~/.agents/bin` first on PATH. You can also use `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/drivers/types/codex/codex-monitor.sh` for explicit monitor launches. The bridge starts on the **first turn** of a new Codex session (the SessionStart hook fires on your first message, not the moment Codex opens), so **restart your Codex session and send one message for monitor to take effect** — this already-running session stays unmonitored until it restarts. For more info: https://github.com/fujibee/agmsg/blob/main/docs/codex-monitor-beta.md"

If argument is "hook on" (legacy alias):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set turn codex "$(pwd)"`
2. Tell the user: "Delivery mode set to 'turn' (legacy hook on behavior)."

If argument is "hook off" (legacy alias):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set off codex "$(pwd)"`
2. Tell the user: "Delivery mode set to 'off'."

If argument is "version":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/version.sh`
2. Show the output — the installed version (git-describe provenance recorded at install time).

If argument is "reset":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/reset.sh "$(pwd)" codex`
2. Tell the user the result.

If argument starts with "rename" but not "rename-team":
1. Accept only an explicit user request. Parse either `<team> <old_name> <new_name>`, or `<old_name> <new_name>` only when this agent belongs to exactly one team.
2. Never invent either name. Before execution, repeat the resolved team, old name, and new name and ask the user to confirm. Wait for confirmation.
3. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/rename.sh <team> <old_name> <new_name>`
4. Show the result. For a connected team, the `member_renamed` journal event propagates the rename to other machines.

If argument starts with "rename-team":
1. Accept only an explicit user request. Parse `<old_team> <new_team>`.
2. Never invent either team name. Before execution, repeat the old and new team names and ask the user to confirm. Wait for confirmation.
3. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/rename-team.sh <old_team> <new_team>`
4. Show the result.

If argument starts with "remote connect":
1. Parse the required `--endpoint <url>` and `<team>`, plus optional `--e2ee`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh connect --endpoint <url> [--e2ee] <team>`
3. Show the output to the user. Plain sync is the default; pass `--e2ee` only when the user explicitly requests end-to-end encryption. The choice is fixed by the first connect.
4. End by showing this copy-paste command for the other machine, with the actual endpoint and team substituted: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh pull --endpoint <actual-url> <actual-team>`

If argument starts with "remote pull":
1. Use this command whenever the user asks to bring in a team that already exists on a server. Never use `join.sh` for that request.
2. Parse the required `--endpoint <url>` and `<team>`, plus optional `--team-id <uuid>`.
3. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh pull --endpoint <url> [--team-id <uuid>] <team>`
4. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "remote unlock":
1. Parse `<team>`, one or more `--snapshot <file>` arguments in ascending revision order, exactly one of `--identity <file>` or `--identity-stdin`, and optional `--confirm-digest <sha256>`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh unlock <team> --snapshot <file> [--snapshot <file> ...] (--identity <file>|--identity-stdin) [--confirm-digest <sha256>]`
3. The snapshot digest must be compared over a separate live channel. Never infer or auto-confirm it. Raw identity material is a permanent secret; when `--identity-stdin` is needed, tell the user to run the command in their own terminal rather than asking them to paste the identity into agent chat.
4. Show the complete result, including the imported-envelope count and engine PID.

If argument starts with "remote status":
1. Parse an optional `<team>` and `--json`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh status [<team>] [--json]`
3. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "remote sync start":
1. Parse the required `<team>`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh sync start <team>`
3. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "remote disconnect":
1. Parse the required `<team>`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh disconnect <team>`
3. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "remote forget":
1. Parse the required `<team>`. This permanently deletes that team's local roster, history, keys, trust, and sync state, but never changes the server.
2. Do not add `--yes` yourself. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/remote.sh forget <team>`
3. The command requires the user to confirm in their terminal. If this agent has no interactive terminal, show the deletion summary and tell the user to rerun the displayed command directly; never bypass confirmation for them.

If argument starts with "key generate" followed by an optional team name:
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/key.sh generate [<team>]`
2. Show the full output to the user, including the mandatory key-backup notice — do not summarize it away.

If argument starts with "key show":
1. Parse an optional team name and `--reveal-secret`.
2. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/key.sh show [<team>] [--reveal-secret]`
3. `--reveal-secret` requires a real interactive terminal and is refused in agent mode — if the user wants to reveal a secret, tell them to run it themselves directly in their own terminal rather than through you.
4. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "key import" followed by a team name:
1. **Do not ask the user to paste the private identity into this chat, and do not run this command yourself.** This identity is a permanent secret. Tell the user to run this directly in their own terminal:
   ```
   read -rsp 'Identity: ' IDENTITY; echo
   printf '%s' "$IDENTITY" | ~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/key.sh import <team> --identity-stdin
   unset IDENTITY
   ```
2. Ask them to paste back only the command's output (never the identity itself) once it's done.
3. **No advanced/automation env-var path is offered for key import** — not even a pre-existing, before-session variable. An identity file is a permanent secret; always use the human-in-own-terminal flow above.

`key rotate` and device-pairing `key request`/`key approve` are not available yet (they refuse unconditionally and change no state) — if the user asks for either, tell them so rather than attempting to run them.
