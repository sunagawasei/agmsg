# Where is THIS session — without the caller ever naming a terminal.
#
# #1171: asked to report its pane, an agent under herdr ran a raw `tmux
# display-message`, got a connection error (there was no tmux server), and
# reported that AS ITS OWN PLACEMENT: "this session is not attached to a
# pane". A failed read of the wrong terminal became a confident negative
# about the caller. That happened because SKILL.md taught tmux's syntax and
# nothing else, and no script exposed a driver-neutral way to ask.
#
# This script is that way. It goes through the same driver auto-detection
# every other self-placement path already uses (actas' self-naming, spawn's
# placement resolution) — the caller never picks a terminal, and never sees
# one to pick. A terminal name in the OUTPUT is diagnostic only, never
# something the caller is meant to branch on.
#
# Usage: where.sh [session_id]
#   session_id — optional. Only herdr's fallback path consults it; herdr's
#   preferred HERDR_PANE_ID path and tmux's $TMUX_PANE need none. Omit it if
#   the caller does not have one.
#
# Output (stdout, one line, key=value):
#   resolved=true placement=<terminal>:<id> terminal=<terminal> container=<container> capabilities=<list>
#     A real, addressable pane was identified. `terminal` names the resolved
#     driver explicitly — not only as the prefix of `placement`, which a
#     caller matching on `terminal=` by itself (as the no-pane branch below
#     already lets it do) would otherwise have to parse out by hand. `container`
#     is best-effort extra context (e.g. the window/tab it lives in); if the
#     driver could not answer THAT sub-question, container names why
#     (unknown:<reason>) — that failure is about the container lookup, not
#     about whether this session has a pane, which is already settled.
#   resolved=true placement=none reason=no_addressable_pane terminal=<name> capabilities=<list>
#     A GENUINE negative: <name> was identified as this session's terminal,
#     and it confirmed it has no addressable pane (a plain OS terminal).
#   resolved=false reason=<text>
#     Placement could NOT be determined. <text> names every terminal that
#     was actually asked and why it did not answer (e.g. "under a terminal
#     but cannot identify this pane to name it — tmux: \$TMUX_PANE is
#     unset — cannot identify this pane"). This is never collapsed into
#     "no pane" — that claim requires resolved=true. There is no terminal to
#     report capabilities for here, so none are printed.
#
# `capabilities` (#1082) is the resolved driver's own manifest ceiling
# (terminal.conf's `capabilities=`), space-separated, verbatim — not a
# restatement written by hand in some doc that can drift from it. A verb
# not listed here will not work on this terminal; that terminal's own
# instructions, at scripts/drivers/terminals/<terminal>/README.md, say which
# listed verbs need more than the ceiling promises (e.g. plain's peek/poke
# need an emulator-qualified placement, not just the capability being listed).
#
# Exit code mirrors `resolved`: 0 when true, 1 when false.
