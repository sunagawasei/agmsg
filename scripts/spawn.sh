# spawn.sh — launch a NEW agent process and have it take an actas identity.
#
# Given an agent-type and an actas <name>, spawn.sh:
#   1. pre-joins <name> to a team for the target project (so the child's
#      actas flow just claims the role instead of prompting for a team),
#   2. opens a place to run it — a tmux pane/window when run inside tmux,
#      otherwise an OS terminal window,
#   3. launches the agent CLI there with `/agmsg actas <name>` as its
#      initial prompt, so the new agent comes up already registered and
#      addressable.
#
# Usage:
#   spawn.sh <agent-type> <name> [options]
#   spawn.sh <agent-type> <name> --boot-prompt "<initial task>" [options]
#
#   <agent-type>   any registered type whose manifest is spawnable: a `cli=`
#                  binary (direct-CLI launch) or a `spawn=` node launcher
#   <name>         actas identity for the spawned agent
#
# Options:
#   --boot-prompt <text>    an initial task for the spawned agent. When given, the
#                      boot prompt becomes the actas slash command followed
#                      (newline-separated) by <text>, so the new agent claims
#                      its identity AND acts on the task in its first turn —
#                      handy for a codex peer (no Monitor), where a message
#                      sent after spawn would never reach the idle session.
#                      An empty string (`--boot-prompt ""`) means no task.
#   --project <path>   project to launch in (default: $PWD)
#   --team <team>      team to join <name> into (default: auto-resolved from
#                      the project's existing registrations; required when the
#                      project belongs to more than one team)
#   --window           open a new tmux WINDOW instead of splitting the pane
#                      (only meaningful inside tmux)
#   --split h|v        tmux split direction when splitting the current window
#                      (h = left/right [default], v = top/bottom)
#   --terminal <tmpl>  terminal command template for the non-tmux path; a
#                      `{cmd}` placeholder is replaced with the path to the
#                      generated boot script (an executable file the terminal
#                      should run). Overrides $AGMSG_TERMINAL and config
#                      `spawn.terminal`.
#   --no-wait          don't block on the readiness handshake; return as soon
#                      as the agent is launched (fire-and-forget)
#   --ready-timeout N  seconds to wait for readiness before giving up
#                      (default 90; on timeout, prints status=timeout, exit 3)
#   --headless         (codex/cursor; types with `headless=yes`) run a no-terminal
#                      bridge worker instead of opening a TUI — the agent talks over
#                      the agmsg bus with no window. codex: neutral scratch cwd under
#                      run/ (read anywhere, write only agmsg's db/teams/run), or the
#                      repo read-only with --reviewer; --project selects the
#                      team/subscription. cursor: always a read-only reviewer in
#                      --project. Tear down with `despawn --force`.
#   --interactive      (codex/cursor; alias --no-headless) force the non-headless
#                      path even when the type's headless default is on (config
#                      spawn.codex_headless / spawn.cursor_headless).
#   --reviewer         (headless codex only) cwd = the target repo (so codex can
#                      autonomously explore it) under a permission profile that
#                      grants the repo READ-only and confines writes to agmsg's
#                      own db/teams/run — a persistent repo reviewer that cannot
#                      modify the repo. --no-reviewer forces it off. Defaults from
#                      config spawn.codex_reviewer. Without it, headless codex sits
#                      in a neutral scratch cwd (read-anywhere, write only agmsg).
#   --implementer      (headless codex only) cwd = the target repo, workspace-write
#                      — the repo is WRITABLE, for implementation work delegated to
#                      codex. --no-implementer forces it off. Mutually exclusive
#                      with --reviewer. Defaults from config
#                      spawn.codex_implementer.<name>.
#   --model <id>       launch the agent on a specific model. The id is passed
#                      through to the CLI unchecked (the CLI rejects unknown
#                      ids); the flag spelling comes from the type's manifest
#                      `model_arg=`. Refused for a type with no model_arg.
#   --fresh            force a brand-new session even when the role has a
#                      resumable prior session. Without it, a type that supports
#                      resume (manifest `resume_arg=`) is brought back into its
#                      last session's context when that transcript still exists
#                      (#339); with it, spawn always boots fresh.
#
# Spawn options: extra CLI args to always pass a given type's launched
# binary (e.g. a default permission mode or sandbox policy), configured
# per-type in a YAML file rather than hardcoded — see
# scripts/lib/spawn-options.sh. File: $AGMSG_SPAWN_OPTIONS_FILE, else
# ~/.agmsg/config/spawn_options.yaml. Optional; a missing file/section is a
# no-op.
#
# Readiness: by default spawn blocks until the new agent's watcher attaches and
# is receiving (it prints `status=ready ...`), so a leader can safely send work
# right after spawn returns without racing the agent's cold start. Types with
# `monitor=no` (codex, cursor, …) have no awaitable readiness sentinel, so the
# wait is skipped for them.
#
# Scope note: spawnable types are those whose manifest declares `spawnable=yes`;
# macOS is the primary target, Linux and
# Windows are best-effort (no guarantee — please open an issue/PR if a given
# terminal does not work). Headless environments (no tmux and no usable
# terminal) error out, because the agent CLIs need an interactive terminal.

# picker, and -- key for the tmux-resurrect hook -- recorded verbatim in the
# argv resurrect saves. Types without the key skip naming (unchanged). The name
# joins team and agent with a '-'; either half may itself contain '-', so the
# role-session record stores the whole `name=` for reverse lookup rather than
# splitting it apart.
# SESSION_NAME (<team>-<agent>) and the resume-or-fresh decision (#339) are both
# computed AFTER team resolution below (a project-resolved --team is only known

# Session-identity env vars to strip from a spawned same-type child (issue #294).
# A terminal launcher (tmux new-window/split-window, a new OS terminal) copies
# the parent shell's exported environment verbatim. When the spawner is itself a

# session-identity vars (claude-code's CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID) and mistakes the
# parent's session for its own — every turn then fails with an Authentication
# error despite valid credentials. Unset them in the generated boot script so the
# child starts with a clean identity.
#
# This reads a dedicated `spawn_unset_env=` manifest key, NOT `detect=`. `detect=`
# names the vars whoami uses to recognize a live session of a type, but those are
