# doctor.sh — "who holds what" in one screen. #267/#605.
#
# Usage: doctor.sh [--project <path>] [--type <type>] [--team <team>] [--redacted]
#        doctor.sh --fix [--yes]
#        doctor.sh --help
#
# Default (no filters): the whole installation -- every team, every project,
# every type. --project / --type / --team narrow it and combine freely. This
# matches how claude/codex/brew/flutter doctor all behave (no scope argument,
# default to everything) rather than requiring a cross-section up front --
# koit's call, made explicit because the earlier <project> <type>-required
# form had it backwards: a reporter who doesn't already know which project/type
# to name can't use a doctor that demands one. Positional <project> <type> is
# not kept for compatibility -- koit judged it not worth carrying (see PR/report
# history for round 2), and a stale positional form alongside flags that mean
# something different by default would be its own source of confusion.
#
# Argument parsing is kept separate from scope-building (the SCOPE loop
# below) so that a future change to what the flags are doesn't have to touch
# how a scope, once decided, gets turned into (project, type) pairs.
#
# Read-only without --fix: never claims, releases, or removes a lock, pidfile,
# or registration. A stale lock or dead pidfile is reported, not cleaned up --
# #605's reporter was asked not to remove a lock by hand because it erases
# the evidence; a doctor that cleaned up on its own would do the same thing to
# itself. --fix (#1507) is the one way it changes anything, only when asked for
# by name: it repairs what doctor found that is safe to repair, shows what it
# will do, and asks once before touching anything (--yes skips only that
# question). Today that is orphaned run/ records; anything doctor learns to
# repair later belongs behind the same flag. It is NOT scripts/fix.sh (/agmsg
# fix), which is a seat repairing its own identity.
#
# Data sources are the existing helpers this project already has for each
# fact -- identities.sh for registrations, actas-lock.sh/instance-id.sh for
# lock ownership and liveness, delivery.sh for mode and watcher/bridge
# status, agmsg_registered_projects for cross-project/cross-type discovery.
# Nothing here recomputes a verdict those already reach; #605's diagnostic
# duplicated agmsg_instance_alive once and that duplication was exactly
# what review pushed back on.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  no warnings
#   1  one or more warnings (see WARNINGS section)
#   2  usage or resolution error

# the team name). One that claims a pane keeps refusing every live seat that
# tries to take it, and nothing else ever looks at it again.
#
# The team a record belongs to is judged from the FILE NAME, never by cutting
# it at "__" and trusting the cut: "__" is legal inside a name (#1023), so
# "a___b" is both team "a_" / agent "b" and team "a" / agent "_b". A record is
# an orphan only when NO possible cut names an existing team ("provably gone");
# it is attributed to one seat only when there is exactly one possible cut and
# decoding it and encoding it back reproduces the file name. Everything else is
# reported as ambiguous and left alone. Id-keyed records (both halves UUIDs,

# --- registry locks that cannot be judged (#865) ----------------------------

# directory as holder.<token>. The next command that needs the lock breaks one
# whose holder is gone, but three kinds stay put and every command for that team
# then waits out its budget and fails:
#   no record     nothing to ask about; a lock taken a moment ago looks the same
#   several       an acquire race caught in the act; nothing says which is current
#   unjudgeable   a record written in another process table, with no scope, a
#                 pid that is not a number, or a name and content that disagree
#   unbreakable   the holder is gone but marked its lock "break no" (the roster
#                 sync driver, which may have left a writer running)

# acquiring side to cooperate: whatever this checks about the directory can stop
# being true before an rmdir runs, and no age or second look closes that. So
# doctor finds them and prints what is there; running a rmdir is the operator's

  # project may not be registered") is the one that explains an empty inbox.
  #
  # Measured while merging: this branch's delivery.sh has no bare `off` at all --
  # all four assignments carry an annotation -- so a condition testing for the
  # bare word collapses nothing, and one testing the first word collapses
