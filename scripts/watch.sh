# Stream new agmsg messages for the current session as they arrive.
#
# Intended to be launched by Claude Code's Monitor tool from the SessionStart
# hook (`session-start.sh`), but also works standalone as `tail -f` for
# inbox: any agent runtime that can read stdout can consume it.
#
# Usage: watch.sh <session_id> <project_path> <agent_type> [active_name]
#
# Behavior:
#   - Resolves (team, agent) pairs for (project_path, agent_type) via
#     identities.sh. By default, subscribes to messages addressed to any
#     of those pairs.
#   - When [active_name] is given, narrows the subscription to only pairs
#     whose agent name matches — useful for `actas` exclusive role mode.
#   - A fresh session sets the high-water mark to the current MAX(id) at
#     startup, so the stream begins with whatever arrives after launch — no
#     replay of historical messages. The mark is persisted per session_id, so
#     a restart of this session's watcher (actas/drop/clear/self-restart)
#     resumes from the last delivered id and does not drop messages that
#     arrived during the restart gap. See #107.
#   - Polls the SQLite DB at AGMSG_WATCH_INTERVAL seconds (default 5, also
#     overridable via the delivery.monitor.poll_interval config key).
#   - Emits one line per new message:
#         <ts> | <team> | <from> → <to> | <body>
#     Newlines in body are escaped to literal "\n" so each message stays a
#     single line — easier for Monitor to deliver as one event.
#   - Writes a pidfile at ~/.agents/agmsg/run/watch.<session_id>.pid and
#     removes it on EXIT / SIGTERM / SIGINT.

# session_id is normally baked into the launch command (CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID /
# GROK_SESSION_ID). An empty first arg is tolerated and resolved below (after the
# libs are sourced) rather than failing hard, so a runtime that cannot bake one
# in — notably Grok Build's `monitor` tool, where "$GROK_SESSION_ID" expands to
# empty — still starts the watcher. A literal `-` first arg is the caller-side
# sentinel for the same "no session id" case: some launcher shells re-evaluate
# the command line and DROP a quoted-but-empty argument entirely (shifting every
# later argument one slot left), so command templates pass
# "${GROK_SESSION_ID:--}" and `-` is folded into the empty-arg path here.
# project_path and agent_type are required. [--team <team>] pins the
# subscription to one team for session-team mode.

# $2/$3 (team, to) scope this to the DEFINITIVE receiver for that role:
#   - an exclusive watcher (ACTIVE_NAME set) only marks its own role's rows.
#   - a broad watcher (ACTIVE_NAME empty) subscribes to every registered role

# sqlite3.exe / Git Bash path mismatch behind #197 is one trigger (now fixed in
# agmsg_db_path), but permissions, a missing binary, or a corrupt file fail the
# same way. A *missing* DB file is normal (no messages sent yet), so only flag
# the case where the file exists but a trivial query cannot run: emit one line
# on stdout (the Monitor event stream) and exit, turning the silent failure into
# a visible one. Done before the ready sentinel so we never signal "ready" for a
