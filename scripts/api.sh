# api.sh — a read-only, JSON-emitting entry point for non-bash consumers
# (a GUI client, a bot in another language — anything that wants agmsg data
# without shelling out to sqlite3 directly). An ordinary core script, same
# standing as send.sh/history.sh/inbox.sh — NOT part of the storage-driver
# ABI (design/storage-axis, in progress as of this writing): that axis stays
# a sourced-function contract external drivers implement, and this stays a
# consumer of it. Queries the sqlite
# store directly for now; once the storage axis lands, the `messages`
# resource's query below is meant to become `storage_history`
# (driver-agnostic), unchanged on the outside — see the JSONL shape note there.
#
# Shaped like a REST contract on purpose — verb + resource words — so
# growing past read-only later (a `post teams <team> messages` == send,
# say) is a new verb branch, not a redesign. v1 only implements `get`.
#
# kubectl-style rather than gh-api-style: fixed resource nouns as separate
# positional args, not a "/teams/<team>/messages" path string. gh api's raw
# path makes sense for a generic HTTP passthrough (any path the real API
# supports just works); this has a small, fully-hardcoded set of routes, so
# a path string would only add parsing/construction overhead on both ends
# for no real flexibility gained.
#
# Usage:
#   api.sh get teams
#   api.sh get teams <team> members
#   api.sh get teams <team> messages [--agent <name>] [--limit N] [--before-id <id>]
#
# Output is always JSONL — one JSON object per line, UTF-8, no
# pretty-printing — for every resource, including `teams` (a uniform
# contract beats a special case a non-bash consumer has to remember).
# Nothing is written; this is read-only. Every id (message ids included) is
# a JSON string, never a bare number — ids are opaque per the driver
# interface spec, and today's sqlite integer ids are no exception.
