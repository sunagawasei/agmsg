# Manage how incoming messages reach this agent.

# Usage:
#   delivery.sh set <mode> <type> <project_path>
#   delivery.sh status [<type> <project_path>]
#   delivery.sh stop
#   delivery.sh restart [<project_path> <type>]
#   delivery.sh default-mode <type>   # echo the configured delivery.default_mode
#                                     # if valid+supported, else nothing (join
#                                     # flow consults this before prompting)
#
# `set`'s <project_path> must already exist as a directory (and be one this
# process can enter), must not be empty/whitespace-only, and must not carry a
# carriage return or newline byte anywhere in it -- it is never created
# implicitly, and a malformed value is rejected rather than silently cleaned
# up. Plain leading/trailing spaces or tabs are valid POSIX path characters
# and are accepted as-is. See agmsg_validate_project_path below (#493).
#
# Modes:
#   monitor  — SessionStart hook → Claude Code Monitor tool → watch.sh stream
#   turn     — Stop hook → check-inbox.sh between turns (legacy)
#   both     — monitor primary; turn as per-session safety net
#   off      — no automatic delivery
#
# `status` reports configured delivery hooks. For Claude Code, `mode: monitor`
# means the project is configured for monitor delivery; runtime success still
# requires Claude Code to start its generic Monitor tool for `agmsg inbox stream`.
#
# settings.json injection is idempotent: each `set` call first strips any
# existing agmsg-owned SessionStart/Stop entries, then re-adds whichever
# the new mode requires. Re-running with the same mode is a no-op.
#
# For in-session activation, several actions print a final
# "AGMSG-DIRECTIVE:" line that a running Claude Code agent reads from the
# command output and acts on (invoke Monitor, TaskStop the watcher). This
# closes the gap where, without the directive, only the *next* session
# would pick up the mode change.

  # no `if type = codex`); its value is the wire shape check-inbox emits.

  # an older parser that rejected it at startup/hooks-review would break turn

  # different codex binary can read the same file without the gate running again.
  # That handling was measured separately: codex 0.116.0 (pre-PostToolUse) reads a
  # PostToolUse-carrying hooks.json and silently ignores the unknown key, no
  # startup/parse error, positive-control confirmed — the Hooks Review screen was

# Reject a malformed project_path before any delivery-apply implementation

# (#493). Every implementation -- agmsg_delivery_apply_default,
# rulefile_apply, and the cursor/copilot/grok-build overrides -- shares this
# file's resolve_hooks_file(), and apply_settings (this function's sole
# caller) is the only place any of them get invoked from, so validating here
# once covers every agent type without touching each apply implementation.
#
# agmsg's primary callers are LLM agents composing this command from a
# SKILL.md, so a literal argument carrying a stray trailing newline (unlike a
# `$(pwd)`-style substitution, which already strips one) is a realistic input,
# not an exotic edge case -- that is exactly the #493 repro, where such a
# value got concatenated verbatim into a hooks_file path and mkdir -p'd into a
# bogus sibling directory nobody asked for.
#
# Policy: reject only the input shapes #493 is actually about, and otherwise
# use the caller's value literally. That is:
#   1. empty, or made up entirely of whitespace (spaces/tabs/CR/LF);
#   2. carrying a CR or LF byte anywhere -- leading, trailing, or embedded
#      (the #493 repro is exactly a trailing LF from adjacent-quote
#      concatenation; a leading or embedded one is just as likely to be the
#      product of a broken command composition, so all three are refused the
#      same way rather than treated as an intentional path byte);
#   3. not already an existing directory; or
#   4. an existing directory this process cannot actually enter.
# A plain leading/trailing space or tab is a valid POSIX path byte -- some
# directories are legitimately named that way -- so it is accepted and used
# as-is, not silently trimmed and not rejected. Rejecting only carries the
# same "loud error naming the exact value, not a silent guess" spirit for the
# shapes above: a caller that built a bad command should see why, not have it
# quietly "corrected" into something that happens to work this one time.
#
# The existence check + traversability probe below mirrors spawn.sh's
# existing --project handling: an unvalidated project_path must never cause a
# directory to be created implicitly.

# rewritten); prints an error naming the offending value to stderr and returns

# Teardown for cursor's per-turn inject watcher (inject-watch.sh): it keeps
# its own pidfile rather than sharing watch.*.pid (see its header), so
# kill_all_watchers above never reaches it — this is its counterpart.
#
# Verified via process-identity.sh's owner/lease sidecar (inject-watch.sh
# bootstraps through process-owner-launch.sh with kind=inject-watch), not the
# cmdline-substring check this used before: review found that check needs
# `ps` (compat_get_cmdline), which is unavailable in some sandboxes — 2
# `delivery set off|turn` tests timed out there waiting for a pidfile that
# was never touched. inject-watch has no legacy pidfile format to be
# compatible with (a brand new kind, unlike watch's), so unlike
# kill_all_watchers there is no project-only (no-type) compatibility form
# here — every real caller supplies both. Args: <project> <type>.
