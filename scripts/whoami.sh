# the registry: two of its three exits echo a name read out of
# agmsg_known_types, but the third is the literal `claude-code` fallback at the
# end of lib/detect-cli-type.sh, which no registry lookup stands behind.
# Validating the RESOLVED value ties
# the no-argument path to that literal still being discoverable — so a broken
# install, or a trust decision that drops the built-in base, would stop
# everyone rather than only the person who mistyped a type. Measured: with
# `claude-code` renamed out of scripts/drivers/types/, validating the resolved
# value turns a plain `whoami.sh <project>` into exit 1, while the same tree
# without the check still answers.
