# Pre-flight claim used by the `actas` skill-command flow.
#
# Usage: actas-claim.sh <project> <type> <name> <session_id>
#
# Looks up which team(s) <name> is registered in for (project, type) and
# attempts to claim the actas exclusivity lock for each matching (team, name)
# pair against <session_id>. The intended call order from the skill template:
#
#   1. join.sh (if <name> is not yet registered)
#   2. actas-claim.sh — this script
#   3. TaskStop the existing Monitor and invoke the new one with <name>
#
# Output (stdout, key=value lines):
#   status=ok team=<team> [team=<team2> ...]              everything claimed
#   status=held team=<team> owner=<owner_sid>             refused — another live session owns it
#   status=not_registered                                  name is not joined to any team in this project/type
#
# Exit code:
#   0 — status=ok
#   1 — status=held (callers should NOT proceed with the actas flow)
#   2 — status=not_registered (callers should run join.sh first)

# BARE_SID, not $SESSION_ID. In THIS script $SESSION_ID has been overwritten with
# the normalized composite "<sid>.<pid>" (above), a token that exists only inside
# agmsg; in session-start.sh the identically named variable holds the BARE sid the
# CLI handed the hook, and it passes that. What a terminal knows is the bare one —
# herdr stores exactly it in agent_session.value — so handing over the composite
# asks a question no terminal can answer. It comes back as "cannot identify this
# pane", which reads as a resolution problem and is an identifier mismatch, and
# the `|| true` below means the claim still reports success while the pane goes
# unnamed and unaddressable. watch.sh does the same lookup and was corrected the

# Start the engine for each claimed team, if one is not already up (#774).
#
# The second of the two trigger points. `actas` is where a session takes on a
# role and therefore a team, and a session that arrives this way never passes
# through session-start's block with that team in hand — a spawn's boot prompt
# is `actas`, so on a rebooted machine this is the first moment the team is
# known.
#
# AFTER the claim and BEFORE the status line: the claim is the thing the caller
# is waiting on, and nothing about starting an engine may delay or fail it.
#
# DELAY IS THE HALF THAT NEEDED WORK. Returning 0 is not enough — a synchronous
# `sync start` holds `status=ok` back for as long as the engine takes to become
# ready, which is up to ~16s per team before the command even gives up. The
# helper bounds the WAIT (`AGMSG_SYNC_AUTOSTART_TIMEOUT_S`, 5s for the whole
# call) and leaves a slow start running rather than killing it. `|| true` says
# the exit-status half a second time.
#
# Whether an engine is already running is not asked here — `sync start` answers
# it under the per-team lock, and the concurrent case (several sessions claiming
# roles at once) is exactly the one a second answer gets wrong. See
