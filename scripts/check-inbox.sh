# No deferral to a live watcher (#694).
#
# This used to exit here whenever a watcher process was alive for this session,
# to avoid double delivery in `both` mode. The condition was LIVENESS, and the
# failure `both` exists for preserves liveness exactly: a watcher that is alive
# and delivering nothing. So the one mode advertised as a safety net stood down
# in front of the one situation it was wanted for. On 2026-08-08 a session with
# a broken watcher was switched to `both` to recover delivery and nothing
# changed; what worked was `mode turn`, which stops the watcher, which removes
# the liveness signal, which lets this hook run.
#
# Removing it does not double-deliver, and that is measured rather than
# assumed. Both sides consume through the same state:
#
#   watcher      storage_read_cursor_consume -> inserts a `message_read` event
#                per delivered id AND advances read_cursors.local_position
#   this hook    storage_list_unread -> excludes rows at or below that cursor
#                AND rows with a `message_read` event
#
# So a message the watcher has emitted is not offered here. The remaining
# window is an interleave: this hook SELECTs, the watcher emits and consumes
# the same row, then this hook marks it read. Bounded by one poll interval, and
# the trade is explicit -- a rare duplicate line against a mode that silently
# delivered nothing at all.
#
# Deferral was an optimisation, not a correctness requirement. The read state
# is the correctness requirement, and it was already there.

# Messages are marked read inside this loop; the whole batch is emitted after

# an EARLIER team's rows were already stamped read_at, before either emit
# point. Those messages are read, undelivered, and never offered again.
# Measured on 8a2fe623: first_deliveries=0 first_read=1 second_unread=1 rc=5.
#
# So a failure stops the loop instead of ending the script, and what was
# already accumulated is delivered.
#
# The failure is reported IN THE PAYLOAD, not by the exit status. The runtimes
# read stdout as control JSON only on exit 0, so a non-zero exit throws the
# delivery away -- which is what the first attempt at this fix did, on exactly

# This fix is correct either way, which is why it doesn't bet on which
# behavior is real: if a runtime DOES discard stdout on non-zero exit (as
# documented), leaving the old `exit "$CLAIM_RC"` here would throw away the
# payload that already cost these rows their unread state -- consumed and
# never shown, worse than the failure this status was meant to protect
# against. If a runtime does NOT discard it (as measured here), the old
# non-zero exit was not needed to preserve the delivery or report the
# partial failure, because the payload already carries both.
# Exiting 0 unconditionally on this path is safe under both, so delivery and
# the report are separated: the messages go out with exit 0, and the partial
# failure is stated inside the payload the operator actually reads. Nothing
# upstream mistakes a partial poll for a complete one, because the text says
