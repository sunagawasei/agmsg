# No deferral to a live watcher (#694).
#
# This used to exit here whenever a watcher process was alive for this session,
# to avoid double delivery in `both` mode. The condition was LIVENESS, and the
# failure `both` exists for preserves liveness exactly: a watcher that is alive
# and delivering nothing. So the one mode advertised as a safety net stood down
# in front of the one situation it was wanted for. On 2026-08-08 a session with
# a broken watcher was switched to `both` to recover delivery and nothing
# changed; what worked was `mode turn`, which stops the watcher, which removes
# the liveness signal, which lets this hook run.
#
# Removing it does not double-deliver, and that is measured rather than
# assumed. Both sides consume through the same state:
#
#   watcher      storage_read_cursor_consume -> inserts a `message_read` event
#                per delivered id AND advances read_cursors.local_position
#   this hook    storage_list_unread -> excludes rows at or below that cursor
#                AND rows with a `message_read` event
#
# So a message the watcher has emitted is not offered here. The remaining
# window is an interleave: this hook SELECTs, the watcher emits and consumes
# the same row, then this hook marks it read. Bounded by one poll interval, and
# the trade is explicit -- a rare duplicate line against a mode that silently
# delivered nothing at all.
#
