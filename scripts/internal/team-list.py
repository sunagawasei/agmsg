"""Aggregate every locally known team's config.json into the strict
`agmsg team list --json` ABI (ADR 0007 family addition). See
scripts/team-list.sh's own header comment for the full field contract.

Reads two small input files by path (never a huge argv, since a
pathological team count/project-path could otherwise blow past ARG_MAX):
  --entries <path>   TAB-separated "<name>\t<config_path>" lines, one per
                      locally known team directory (already existence-
                      checked and bounded by the caller).
  --variants <path>  one project-path spelling per line (from
                      agmsg_project_path_variants) — a team is "project"-
                      scoped if ANY agent registration's `project` field
                      exactly matches ANY of these.

Each config.json is read up to --max-config-bytes+1 bytes and rejected
(skipped, with a stderr warning naming the team) if it exceeds that
bound, isn't valid UTF-8 JSON, isn't a JSON object, or contains a
duplicate key at any nesting depth (the same #87/D4-class strict-parsing
discipline this ADR family already applies to server-supplied JSON —
config.json is locally written by our own scripts, but this is a
read-only listing command with no reason to guess at a malformed file's
meaning rather than skip it outright).

Fail-closed in --format json specifically (co1 delta review): --scope all
is the authority a no-arg cloud connect flow uses to decide whether its
choice is ambiguous (one team vs several). Silently returning a partial
list as if it were the complete one — because one team's config failed
to parse, or the caller's own MAX_TEAMS bound was hit — could make a
driver see "1 team" or "0 teams" and auto-select/report ambiguity
wrongly, when the true count differs. So in JSON mode, if ANY team was
skipped or the entries list was truncated upstream (--truncated), this
prints NO JSON payload at all and exits 2, rather than a "successful"
partial object a consumer could mistake for authoritative. Human mode
(--format human) keeps printing whatever was found plus the warnings and
exits 0 — a person reading it isn't fooled by partial output the way an
automated ambiguity check would be, and seeing what's readable is more
useful to them than a bare error.
