# The antigravity driver's fail-closed reads: the transport's ownership gate,
# and the supervisor's start token.
#
# inbox-transport.sh's ownership gate. It sits in front of `peek` (reads the
# inbox) and `ack` (marks read, which does not come back), and it is the only
# thing between the bridge and another session's messages.
#
# The gate has three answers and the existing suite reached exactly ONE of them.
# `antigravity_bridge.test.mjs` always runs with the lock the bridge itself just
# claimed, so every path through it is "the owner matches" -- the refusals were
# never executed, in either flavour, by anything. That is the same shape this
# driver's review has now hit three times: a check that exists, and a test set
# in which nothing can reach it. Each case below is reached on purpose, and the
# match case is kept alongside so "refuse everything" cannot pass. (#1090)
