# if the column took a text affinity BOTH stores store text and the two sides
# match. A green EXCEPT then means "identical", not "correct", and the shared
# rows are deleted on the strength of it.
#
# The values here come from send.sh, so this is a statement about the
# product's own write path, not about a literal this test inserted. That
# distinction is the whole point (tl ruling): a typeof() check on a value the
# test wrote proves the test can write an integer.
#
# read_cursors is NOT here. A text AFFINITY on that column turns the 1005/999
# re-entry test below red, so checking for that would be a second copy of an
# existing catch. Its storage class is looked at by no test in this
# repository — see the note on that test for why the gap is worse than
# undetected.
