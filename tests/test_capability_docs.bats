# #1082: the terminal driver declares its capabilities (terminal.conf); the
# agent-facing text should reflect that, not restate it by hand where it can
# drift. This file pins three things: SKILL.md no longer carries the
# per-driver exit-code detail it used to (that moved out and got shorter,
# not just longer-in-a-new-place), each shipped driver has its own doc file
# that matches what its manifest actually declares, and plain's — the one
# driver missing several verbs — says so rather than describing verbs it does
# not have.

# Review (#1209) found that the first version of these per-driver docs claimed 13
# for herdr's and tmux's own peek/poke -- a code neither driver's own
# terminal_peek/terminal_poke ever returns (a target that never existed is
# refused by the caller's ref parser before any driver loads; 13 belongs to
# plain, whose peek/poke genuinely can be unsupported at the instance level).
# A doc that restates the driver-crossing classification error #1082 exists
# to remove is worse than the doc it replaced. The two tests below are the
# fix for HOW that slipped past review the first time: the earlier version of
# this file only checked that a heading and a verb name were present, never
# that the rc numbers under it were real. These read the actual `return N`
# statements out of each driver's own function body and require the doc's
# claimed set to match exactly -- neither a code the function cannot return,
# nor a missing one it does.
