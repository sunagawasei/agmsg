# `agmsg <verb>` is the wrong guess the docs taught — a sweep of docs/design
# and docs/spec found 34 backticked commands assuming a CLI that does not
# exist. Fixing the documents does not help the person who types from memory,
# so the refusal has to name the real form.
#
# Asserted on the PATH being present, not on the wording: the value of this
# message is that it tells you what to type instead, and a test that only
# checked for "not a command" would pass on the old text.
