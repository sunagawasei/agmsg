#
# The contract is theirs, not ours: stdout is read as control JSON only when
# the process exits 0. A non-zero exit is logged as a hook failure and the
# output is DISCARDED. Asserting on the shell's stdout alone cannot see that —
# the first attempt at this fix emitted the messages and then exited non-zero,
# so it was inert on the only path that was broken while its tests passed.
#
# The parse is part of the contract too. Returning raw stdout would stay green
# for malformed JSON, for a payload under some other key, or for text outside
# `reason` — none of which an operator would ever see. So this parses, requires
# `decision` to be `block`, and returns ONLY `reason`: exactly the bytes the
# runtime puts in front of a person.
