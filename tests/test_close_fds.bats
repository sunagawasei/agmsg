# A long-lived child must not inherit descriptors above stderr.
#
# The failure this guards is silent and expensive: bats hands its result and
# trace descriptors to whatever it runs, a spawned engine or bridge keeps them
# for as long as it lives, and bats then waits for an EOF that cannot arrive.
# Every test reports ok and the CI shard runs to the job cap — observed twice on
# one head, ~25 minutes each, with `Terminate orphan process: (node)` at
# cleanup. Nothing in the test output says what happened.
#
# Asserted on what the child SEES, not on the source of the launcher. A grep for
# `agmsg_close_inherited_fds` would pass on a script that calls it too late, or
# after it has already forked.

# THE HAZARD, shown first: run under bats, a plain child already inherits
# descriptors nobody opened. Measured here rather than asserted from the code —
# on this harness the baseline is `0 1 2 3 4 5 6`, and 5 and 6 are bats's own.
# Those are what a bridge or engine would hold for its whole life.
#
# 3 and 4 belong to the measurement itself (the command-substitution pipe and
# the directory handle), which is why the check below is "nothing above 4"
# rather than a fixed list — the first version of this test asserted 3 and 4
# were absent and failed against a correct implementation.

# close the sourcing shell's descriptors — true, and not a reason to leave the
# leak: wrapping only the spawn in a subshell closes the child's copies and
