# teardown_test_env must kill a detached process still holding $TEST_SKILL_DIR before
# it removes the tree. The detached codex children (codex-bridge-launcher.sh and the
# codex-bridge.js it starts) outlive the test body and keep writing $TEST_SKILL_DIR/run,
# so the bare rm races them and fails "Directory not empty" (#662 == #1036 == #1049).
# The reaper is scoped to the unique mktemp $TEST_SKILL_DIR so it can never reach a real
# bridge or another test — that scope safety is asserted here, not just the kill.
#
# Assertions use plain commands / `refute`, never a non-last `[[ ]]` or `! cmd` (#670).
