# Self-naming on action (scripts/lib/self-name.sh): a seat that sends or reads
# names its own pane if it is not named, from its environment, at the cost of
# one file read in the common case. Pinned here, each with a control the other
# way, and every terminal call counted through a fake that logs its argv:
#
#   - mark present and matching       -> the terminal is not called at all
#   - mark present, pane differs       -> named again, mark rewritten
#   - mark present, server restarted   -> named again (the epoch changed)
#   - mark present, name gone, nothing else changed -> NOT seen (blind spot,
#                                         pinned as such)
#   - no mark                          -> named once, mark written
#   - another seat in the same pane    -> NOT taken while the first seat's record
#                                         claims it (#1114 placement guard, kept

#                                         and returns to that only if the guard goes)
#   - order independence: a boot path first, then the action; the action
#     first, then a boot path -- same key, one terminal call in total
#   - herdr identifies its pane from HERDR_PANE_ID with no session id
#   - the action commands (send / inbox / history) run the hook, and a failure
