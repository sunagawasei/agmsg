# Unit tests for codex-bridge-launcher.sh thread resolution (#350).
# The launcher must bind the bridge to the role's RECORDED codex thread instead
# of the app-server's ambiguous "loaded" thread (which a co-resident codex thread
# in the same cwd could otherwise capture). A mock bridge records the --thread
# the launcher passes.
#
# The mock replaces codex-bridge.js itself (the file the launcher's DEFAULT
# bridge_run resolves to) rather than being swapped in via AGMSG_CODEX_BRIDGE_CMD
# (#595). AGMSG_CODEX_BRIDGE_CMD is a real, documented user-facing override (a
# custom bridge wrapper), and codex-bridge-launcher.sh takes a materially
# different code path for it (a synchronous wait on the launched process) than
# for its default codex-bridge.js path -- exercising that override path here
# tested a branch these tests have no interest in and does not run for anyone
# using agmsg without a custom wrapper, and its wait, sized for a real bridge
# process's lifetime, raced these tests' shorter deregistration-response
# assertions. Only tests/ files change here: setup_test_env already copies the
# whole scripts/ tree into an isolated $TEST_SKILL_DIR per test, so overwriting
# codex-bridge.js below mutates only that disposable copy.
