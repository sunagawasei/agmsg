# READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THE POSITIVE CASE. Every `proved` in this file is
# built on a SYNTHETIC process tree. That is deliberate and it is also a
# limitation: as of writing, the seat running these tests cannot produce a live
# `proved` -- its own lineage is `claude bg-spare` -> `claude bg-pty-host` ->
# launchd and reaches no pane. A synthetic positive proves the CONTRACT (that the
# classifier says `proved` when the intersection is there); it is NOT evidence
# that any particular seat can obtain one. Those are different claims and this

#
# MEASURED, and it is the whole reason this helper exists: with `set -e` applied
# in `setup()` and the call made through `run`, reverting an errexit-safe capture
# to the defective `x="$(cmd)"; rc=$?` produced ZERO reds. bats' `run` turns
# errexit off for the command it invokes, and so does putting the call on the
# left of `&&` or `||`. Both of the obvious ways to write this test are therefore
# blind to the defect the test is FOR. A caller that simply calls the function
# is not, so that is what this runs.
#
# WHAT THE DIFFERENCE ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE. Under a caller's errexit, a function
# that returns non-zero as a bare statement kills that caller -- correct code and
# defective code alike. So the child dying is NOT the signal. The signal is
# whether the verdict reached stdout first:
#
#   correct    the verdict line is printed, then the caller dies on the status
#   defective  the shell dies inside the capture, and there is NO verdict line
#
# So the probe reads stdout and the exit status, and never requires the child to
# have survived a non-zero verdict.
