# Agent Messaging

**IMPORTANT: Always use the provided scripts. NEVER directly read or edit config files, DB, or team data. There is NO register.sh — use join.sh to join a team.**

**Shell requirement:** All agmsg scripts are Bash scripts. Always execute them via `bash`, never via PowerShell or cmd directly. If your default shell is not Bash (e.g. PowerShell on Windows), wrap every command with `bash -lc '...'`. Example: `bash -lc '~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/send.sh myteam alice bob "hello"'`. Do NOT construct DB paths manually — the scripts handle path resolution internally. If you need to redirect storage, use `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH` (the supported override).

## How to use

### Step 0: First-run bootstrap

agmsg keeps its SQLite database, team registry, and runtime state under `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/`. The `./install.sh` install path creates that tree; the Claude Code plugin install path does not (the plugin marketplace flow only drops the skill content into `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`). Before any other command, bootstrap if needed:

```bash
if [ ! -d ~/.agents/skills/agmsg ]; then
  # Locate the plugin install script (any version), run it once.
  installer=$(ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/fujibee-agmsg/agmsg/*/install.sh 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  if [ -n "$installer" ]; then
    bash "$installer" --cmd agmsg
  else
    echo "agmsg not installed. Either:" >&2
    echo "  - run ./install.sh in the agmsg repo, or" >&2
    echo "  - install via /plugin marketplace add fujibee/agmsg && /plugin install agmsg@fujibee-agmsg" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

After this runs once, `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/` is populated and you can skip Step 0 on future invocations.

### Step 1: Check identity

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/whoami.sh "$(pwd)" <type>
# type: claude-code, codex, gemini, antigravity, copilot
# Returns: agent=... / multiple=true ... / suggest=true ... / not_joined=true ...
```

### Step 2a: If not in a team — join one

Before first-time setup, inspect the user's request. If they ask to join,
import, or bring in a team that already exists on a server, do not run
`join.sh`. Go directly to the `remote pull` command under Step 2b. Before
pulling, run `team-list.sh --json --scope all`; if a same-named local team has
`binding_state` `none` or `disconnected`, stop and ask the user how to proceed.
After pull succeeds, return here so the user can register a new local agent in
the team that pull just created.

Ask the user for a team name. If it's an existing team, run `team.sh <team>` first to see the current roster and note the names already in use. Look for a naming convention already in play (e.g. a shared base name with role and number suffixes (`<base>-<role><n>`), or names derived from the team name) and, when one exists, propose 2-3 unused names that extend it; otherwise propose 2-3 short, distinctive identity names (not a bare tool-type label like `codex`/`cc`). Either way, names must not collide with the roster. For a brand-new team, skip the roster check and just ask. Then run:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh <team> <agent_name> <type> "$(pwd)" [--force]
```

Do NOT manually edit config files. Always use join.sh. If the name was recently renamed away with `rename.sh`, join.sh refuses to revive it (printing the new name it maps to) instead of silently re-registering it — this guards against a CLI slash-command history resubmitting `actas <old_name>` after a rename. Pass `--force` only for a deliberate, unrelated reuse of that exact name.

### Step 2b: If already in a team — execute command

**Default (no arguments): IMMEDIATELY check inbox. Do NOT ask what to do.**

```bash
# Check inbox (marks messages as read) — DEFAULT action
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/inbox.sh <team> <agent_id>

# Send a message (one-way: notifications, acks, fire-and-forget, control).
# Returns immediately. From/to must already be registered; --force bypasses
# membership validation for intentional pre-registration sends.
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/send.sh <team> <from_agent> <to_agent> "<message>" [--force]

# Ask and wait for a reply (request/reply). BLOCKS until <to_agent> replies, then
# prints it. Use for questions/requests/consultations where you expect an answer —
# on Claude Code this holds the turn open so the terminal stays "running" while
# waiting. Defaults: --timeout 300 --interval 2.
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/send.sh <team> <from_agent> <to_agent> "<message>" --wait [--timeout <sec>] [--interval <sec>]
# High-level verb (same thing via the dispatcher / `agmsg` CLI): `send` = one-way,
# `ask` = request/reply (= send + --wait). Trailing --timeout/--interval are options;
# a flag inside the message is kept verbatim, and `--` forces the rest to be body.
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/windows/dispatch.sh --team <team> --agent <from_agent> -- ask <to_agent> "<message>" [--timeout <sec>] [--interval <sec>]

# Message history
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/history.sh <team> [agent_id] [limit]

# List team members
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/team.sh <team>

# List every locally known team (read-only, secret-free — "agmsg team list").
# Distinct from `team.sh <team>` above: check for "team list" FIRST so
# "list" is never mistaken for a team name. --json emits a strict,
# versioned object ({schema_version, teams: [{name, remote_team_id, scope,
# binding_state}]}) and exits non-zero with NO payload if any team was
# unreadable or the count was truncated — never a partial list dressed up
# as complete. See scripts/team-list.sh's own header comment for the exact
# enums and why onboarding_state/promote_eligible/blocked_reason are
# deliberately NOT in this schema yet (their meaning depends on ADR 0010,
# which hasn't landed).
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/team-list.sh [--json] [--scope all|project] [<project_path>]

# Leave a team
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/leave.sh <team> <agent_id>

# Rename a team (moves dir, updates config + messages).
# After renaming, each existing member should re-run whoami.sh to refresh
# their cached team name in any running session.
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/rename-team.sh <old_team> <new_team>

# Show the installed version — the git-describe provenance string recorded at
# install time (tag + commits-since + abbreviated commit, plus -dirty when
# installed from a tree with uncommitted changes). See #117.
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/version.sh

# Clear registrations for the current project/type.
# A trailing <session_id> additionally releases any actas exclusivity locks
# this session held on <agent_id> so peers can pick them up immediately.
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/reset.sh "$(pwd)" <type> [agent_id] [session_id]

# Set delivery mode for this project.
#   monitor — real-time push via SessionStart + Monitor tool (claude-code only)
#   turn    — Stop-hook pulls at the end of each assistant turn
#   both    — monitor primary, turn as fallback
#   off     — no automatic delivery
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/delivery.sh set <mode> <type> "$(pwd)"
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/delivery.sh status <type> "$(pwd)"

# Skip the per-project mode prompt: set a default the Claude Code join flow
# auto-applies (unset/invalid/unsupported = ask each time). Currently consulted
# by the claude-code join flow only; other types still prompt at join.
#   agmsg config set delivery.default_mode <monitor|turn|both|off>
# `delivery.sh default-mode <type>` echoes the resolved default (empty = ask).
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/delivery.sh default-mode <type>

# Multiple roles per project (one CC = one active role).
# Claude Code: `actas` claims an exclusivity lock for <name> across sessions
# and restarts the Monitor filtered to <name> only; peer watchers stop
# subscribing to <name> while this session holds the lock. `drop` releases.
# Codex: actas is send-side only (no stable session_id during slash commands
# → no peer-visible lock). See README "Codex caveat" for details.
# If <name> is new and none was given upfront (bare `actas`, or the user asks
# for a suggestion), check the target team's roster first (team.sh <team>).
# Look for a naming convention already in play (e.g. a shared base name with
# role and number suffixes (<base>-<role><n>), or names derived from the
# team name) and, when one exists, propose 2-3 unused names that extend it;
# otherwise propose 2-3 short, distinctive names. Either way, names must not
# collide with the roster. Ask the user to pick before continuing.
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/actas-claim.sh "$(pwd)" <type> <name> "$session_id"
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/reset.sh "$(pwd)" <type> <name> "$session_id"

# (Both of the above are normally driven by `/agmsg actas <name>` and
#  `/agmsg drop <name>` slash commands, which also handle the Monitor
#  TaskStop + relaunch dance described in the cmd template.)

# Spawn a NEW agent process that takes an actas identity on boot.
# Pre-joins <name> to a team, then launches the agent CLI in a tmux pane/window
# (when run inside tmux) or a new OS terminal, with `/agmsg actas <name>` as the
# initial prompt. By default it BLOCKS until the new agent's watcher attaches
# (prints `status=ready`), so a leader can send work right after spawn returns
# without losing it to the agent's cold start. Spawnable types are registry-driven
# (manifest `spawnable=yes` or a `spawn=` launcher; run `spawn.sh` with no args to
# list them). macOS primary, Linux/Windows best-effort. Non-tmux + no usable terminal (headless)
# errors out.
#   --project <path>     project to launch in (default: $PWD)
#   --team <team>        team to join into (default: auto-resolved from project)
#   --window             new tmux window instead of splitting the current one
#   --split h|v          tmux split direction (default h)
#   --terminal <tmpl>    terminal command template ({cmd} = path to the boot
#                        script) for the non-tmux path; overrides $AGMSG_TERMINAL
#                        / config spawn.terminal. macOS default uses `open -a`
#                        (no Automation/TCC permission prompt).
#   --no-wait            don't block on readiness (fire-and-forget)
#   --ready-timeout N    seconds to wait for readiness (default 90; on timeout
#                        prints status=timeout and exits 3). Types with
#                        `monitor=no` (codex, cursor, …) skip the wait.
#   --boot-prompt <text>      hand the new agent an initial task: the boot prompt
#                        becomes the actas command followed (newline-separated)
#                        by <text>, so it claims its identity AND starts the task
#                        in its first turn. The only way to give a one-shot goal
#                        to a codex peer (no Monitor → a post-spawn send to its
#                        idle session is never noticed).
#   --headless           (codex/cursor; types with `headless=yes`) run a no-terminal
#                        bridge worker instead of a TUI. codex: scratch cwd under
#                        `run/`, optional `--reviewer` for repo read-only or
#                        `--implementer` for repo WRITABLE (mutually exclusive).
#                        cursor: always a read-only reviewer in `--project`.
#                        Tear down with `despawn --force` (neither has a Monitor
#                        watcher).
#   --interactive        (codex/cursor; alias --no-headless) force the non-headless
#                        path even when the type's headless default is on (config
#                        spawn.codex_headless / spawn.cursor_headless).
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/spawn.sh <agent-type> <name> [options]

# Tear down a spawned member — the inverse of spawn.
# Default (graceful): sends a `ctrl:despawn` control message to <name>; the
# member's watcher drops its own role (releasing the actas lock + registration)
# and closes its own tmux pane, ending the agent. Blocks until the lock releases
# (--timeout, default 30s) then prints `status=ok`; on timeout prints
# status=timeout and exits 3 (retry with --force). Only an exclusive watcher
# dedicated to <name> acts on it — the despawning session is never torn down.
# --force: skip the message and tear the member down from the placement recorded
# at spawn time (kill its tmux pane/window, drop its registration) — for a dead
# watcher or a codex member (no Monitor). A hand-started member with no placement
# record can't be --forced.
#   --force              tear down from the recorded placement, no message
#   --timeout N          seconds to wait for graceful teardown (default 30)
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/despawn.sh <team> <from> <name> [--force] [--timeout N]
```

### Rename

If argument starts with "rename" but not "rename-team":
1. Accept only an explicit user request. Parse either `<team> <old_name> <new_name>`,
   or `<old_name> <new_name>` only when this agent belongs to exactly one team.
2. Never invent either name. Before execution, repeat the resolved team, old name,
   and new name and ask the user to confirm. Wait for confirmation.
3. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/rename.sh <team> <old_name> <new_name>`
4. Show the result. For a connected team, the `member_renamed` journal event
   propagates the rename to other machines.

If argument starts with "rename-team":
1. Accept only an explicit user request. Parse `<old_team> <new_team>`.
2. Never invent either team name. Before execution, repeat the old and new team
   names and ask the user to confirm. Wait for confirmation.
3. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/rename-team.sh <old_team> <new_team>`
4. Show the result.

### Remote sync

Every agmsg step above runs through the host's Bash tool, so on Claude Code each call is gated by the permission system until you allowlist the script directory. Add these to `~/.claude/settings.json` (or project-level `.claude/settings.local.json`):

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/*)",
      "Bash(/Users/<you>/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/*)",
      "Bash(bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/*)",
      "Bash(bash /Users/<you>/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

If argument starts with "remote pull":
1. When the user asks to join or bring in a team that already exists on a
   server, NEVER use `join.sh`, create a team, or create a same-named local
   team. Always use remote pull.
2. Before pulling, check for a same-named local team. If one already exists
   without an active remote connection, stop and ask the user how to proceed;
   do not overwrite, merge, connect, or rename it on your own.
3. Parse the required `--endpoint <url>` and `<team>`, plus optional
   `--team-id <uuid>`.
4. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/remote.sh pull --endpoint <url> [--team-id <uuid>] <team>`
5. Show the output to the user.

Machine B needs its own install, not just its own environment variables.
Only `remote.sh`, `remote-sync.sh`, `key.sh` and the two internal helpers read
`AGMSG_SYNC_CONNECTION_DIR`; `send.sh`, `history.sh`, `team.sh` and `inbox.sh`
resolve the team config from the install directory. So a pull driven by
environment variables alone succeeds, and the send that is supposed to confirm
it then reports the team as missing — the failure lands one step after the
cause. See "Use a separate install for testing" in `docs/remote-setup.md`.

If argument starts with "remote unlock":
1. Parse `<team>`, `--bundle <file>`, and `--confirm-digest <sha256>`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/remote.sh unlock <team> --bundle <file> --confirm-digest <sha256>`
3. The snapshot digest must be compared over a separate live channel. Never
   infer or auto-confirm it. The bundle is permanent secret key material; tell
   the user to transfer and handle it only through their own trusted channel,
   never by pasting it into agent chat.
4. Show the complete result, including the imported-envelope count and engine
   PID.
5. The advanced form with repeatable `--snapshot` plus `--identity` or
   `--identity-stdin` remains available when explicitly requested.

If argument starts with "remote status":
1. Parse an optional `<team>` and `--json`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/remote.sh status [<team>] [--json]`
3. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "remote sync start":
1. Parse the required `<team>`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/remote.sh sync start <team>`
3. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "remote disconnect":
1. Parse the required `<team>`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/remote.sh disconnect <team>`
3. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "remote forget":
1. Parse the required `<team>`. This permanently deletes that team's local
   roster, history, keys, trust, and sync state, but never changes the server.
2. Do not add `--yes` yourself. Run:
   `bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/remote.sh forget <team>`
3. The command requires the user to confirm in their terminal. If this agent
   has no interactive terminal, show the deletion summary and tell the user to
   rerun the displayed command directly; never bypass confirmation for them.

### End-to-end encryption

If argument starts with "key generate" followed by an optional team name:
1. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/key.sh generate [<team>]`
2. Show the full output to the user, including the mandatory key-backup notice.

If argument starts with "key show":
1. Parse an optional team name and `--reveal-secret`.
2. Run: `bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/key.sh show [<team>] [--reveal-secret]`
3. `--reveal-secret` requires a real interactive terminal and is refused in
   agent mode. Tell the user to run it directly in their own terminal.
4. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "key handoff" followed by a team name:
1. Parse optional `--out <file>` and run:
   `bash ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/key.sh handoff <team> [--out <file>]`
2. The output bundle contains every epoch identity and is itself permanent
   secret key material. Never read it into agent chat or display its contents.
3. Show the bundle path, latest snapshot digest, and full secrecy warning.

If argument starts with "key import" followed by a team name:
1. Do not ask the user to paste the private identity into this chat, and do not
   run the command yourself. Tell the user to run this in their own terminal:
   ```
   read -rsp 'Identity: ' IDENTITY; echo
   printf '%s' "$IDENTITY" | ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/key.sh import <team> --identity-stdin
   unset IDENTITY
   ```
2. Ask them to paste back only the command output, never the identity itself.
3. Do not offer an environment-variable path. An identity file is a permanent
   secret; always use the human-in-own-terminal flow above.

`key rotate` and device-pairing `key request`/`key approve` are not available
yet. If the user asks for one, tell them so instead of attempting to run it.

## Sandbox compatibility (Claude Code)

When Claude Code's sandbox is enabled, `watch.sh` (monitor mode) runs inside the sandbox and needs to write pidfiles and SQLite WAL files under `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/`. Add an allowlist entry to `~/.claude/settings.json` (or project-level `.claude/settings.local.json`):

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "filesystem": {
      "allowWrite": [
        "~/.agents/skills/agmsg/"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The allowlist merges across scopes and takes effect immediately — no restart needed. If agmsg was installed under a custom command name (e.g. `m`), adjust the path accordingly.

**Note on `BASH_SOURCE`**: The sandboxed Bash tool runs commands via pipe/eval, so `BASH_SOURCE[0]` is empty inside sourced functions like `storage.sh`. This is handled internally — `watch.sh` resolves `SKILL_DIR` from `$0` (which works correctly when invoked as a command), and `storage.sh` falls back to that value. No user configuration needed.

## Architecture

- **Storage**: SQLite with WAL mode in `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/db/messages.db`
- **Teams**: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/teams/<name>/config.json`
- **Concurrency**: WAL allows multiple readers + 1 writer without conflicts
- **No daemon**: Direct DB access via `sqlite3` CLI
- **Dependencies**: bash, sqlite3 (no python3 required)
