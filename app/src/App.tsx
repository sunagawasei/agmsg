  // Lifecycle robustness (co1 review, PR #481 — the first version only
  // listened for pointermove/pointerup/Escape):
  // - setPointerCapture on the source button, released on cleanup: without
  //   it, the pointer leaving the OS window before release means pointerup
  //   never reaches `document` at all, leaking swapSource/preview/chip and
  //   the listeners themselves forever (a stuck "ghost" drag).
  // - pointerId is captured at start and checked on every subsequent event
  //   — a second pointer's events (another touch/pen input) must never
  //   drive or finish someone else's gesture.
  // - pointercancel and window blur (app loses focus mid-drag — e.g. an OS
  //   dialog, Cmd-Tab) both force finish(false), same as Escape.
  // - a real drag can still end with the pointer back over the SOURCE
  //   button (drag out and back, or Escape-cancel then release there) —
  //   that DOES fire a native click on it same as any other press/release
  //   pair landing on the same element, which would otherwise also run
  //   onClick's swap-arm toggle right after finish() already handled the
  //   gesture as a drag. dragJustFinishedRef (declared above, checked by
  //   the pane-header's own onClick) is a per-pane, short bounded window
  //   rather than an unbounded "consume the next click" listener — see its
  //   own doc for why (co1 review, PR #481, 2nd round: a drag that ends via
  //   blur/pointercancel/unmount with the pointer released outside the app
  //   never gets a matching click to consume at all, so a pending listener
  //   would sit on the button forever and wrongly swallow the next,
  //   unrelated real click).
  // - activePaneDragCancelRef (declared above) lets unmount force a cancel;
  //   real listeners still live on document/window, outside React's tree.
  //   Also force-cancels any still-active PRIOR gesture at the start of a
  //   new one — multi-pointer input could otherwise overwrite the ref
  //   without ever tearing down the first gesture's listeners.
