 * the transposed result col(row(1,3;r),row(2,4;r);c) is ITSELF a valid
 * aligned-grid input (its two children match). For 3+ columns this doesn't
 * hold — e.g. transposing a 3-column grid produces
 * col(row(1,4;r), col(row(2,5;r),row(3,6;r);c2); c1), whose own two
 * top-level children (a 1-level pair vs. a 2-level chain) no longer match
 * each other, so a second transposeGrid call is just a no-op rather than
 * reconstructing the original 2-row form. This is fine for how the app
 * actually uses this: grabbing a segment transposes once and then only
 * drags that segment's own node — nothing ever needs to un-transpose.
 *
 * Returns `node` unchanged if it isn't an aligned grid (not a split whose
 * two children are themselves matching further-split chains) — the plain
 * single-divider, whole-grid-drag fallback applies there, same as any
 * asymmetric or manually-adjusted tree today. Deliberately scoped to
