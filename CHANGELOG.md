# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `spawn.codex_model.<name>` / `spawn.codex_effort.<name>` config keys: per-worker
  model and reasoning-effort overrides for headless codex workers, spliced into
  the app-server command as `-c model="..."` / `-c model_reasoning_effort="..."`
  with fail-closed charset validation. `--model` now reaches the headless codex
  path too (previously silently ignored); precedence: `--model` >
  `spawn.codex_model.<name>` > global codex config.
- `delivery.default_mode` config: set a machine-wide default delivery mode the
  join flow auto-applies, skipping the per-project prompt. Resolved per-type via
  `delivery.sh default-mode <type>` (honored only where the type supports the
  mode; unset/invalid/unsupported falls back to asking).
