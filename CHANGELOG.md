# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Terminal drivers for tmux, herdr, and plain OS terminal windows: `peek`, `poke`, and `arrange` work through whichever terminal a member runs in (#1014, #1060, #1078, #1163, #1207)
- `peek` with no member name summarizes the screens of the whole local team (#1194)
- `where` reports this session's terminal, its pane, and the operations that terminal supports; Claude Code sessions are told their terminal at start (#1082, #1173, #1224)
- `team` shows, for each teammate, whether `peek`, `poke`, and `arrange` can reach it, and why not when they cannot (#1232)
- `fix`: a session proves which pane it is running in and repairs only its own name and placement records (#1152, #1157, #1188, #1191, #1227)
- A session names its own pane when it acts, and `spawn` names the pane it created and sets its agent key (#1065, #1080, #1099)
- `send` accepts `--body-file <path>` and `--body -` (stdin) like `poke`, and refuses a body that looks like a flag (#1101)
- Antigravity (`agy`): the skill is installed where `agy` discovers skills, and monitor delivery with safe automatic resume is available on Linux (#1090, #1223)
- Report a mark-read that lost to a concurrent writer (#1011) (#1013)
- Deliver the inbox mid-turn via a PostToolUse hook, not only at Stop (#1003) (#1004)

### Changed
- `team` is read-only: the leader-side repair options `--fix`, `--fix-pane-names`, and `--rename-sessions` are removed; each session repairs itself with `fix` (#1152, #1211, #1213)
- actas lock, readiness, and spawn records are keyed by team and member id, so team or member names containing `__` no longer collide (#1023)
- Agent type detection follows an explicit priority, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` on its own is only a last resort (#1247)
- Per-driver notes live at `scripts/drivers/terminals/<driver>/README.md`; `install --update` removes the old `SKILL.md` copies (#1248)

### Fixed
- Codex seats that hold an actas lock no longer drop out of their own bridge's delivery, and spawned seats do not inherit it (#1239, #1245)
- Claude Code's `actas` and `drop` instructions again start the watcher through the Monitor tool and confirm it attached (#1237)
- `spawn` skips the readiness wait only when delivery is explicitly off or turn (#647)
- A graceful `despawn` waits for the pane to close, not only for the lock (#1097)
- herdr socket paths containing `:` round-trip through placement records (#1166)
- `watch` and `inbox` deliver a backlog past the argument-length limit instead of failing silently (#777, #1045)
- `check-inbox` consumes rows only after the payload is written (#1026)
- The Windows hook payload stays off the login shell's stdout (#1015)
- Antigravity's delivery plug parses under bash 3.2 (#1244)
- Pass non-remote subcommands through (#590)
- The remaining argv-to-stdin sites, plus a Windows CRLF row-separator bug (#991)
- Give the identity lease a start token on Windows (#978)
- One wake, one turn — attribute mid-start turn-end signals by turn id (#889)
- Discover a ws:// app-server in the SessionStart plug (#1057)
- Refuse a non-string envelope.blob/cipher instead of storing "null" (#1042) (#1048)
- Count roster mutations as held so the read frontier can advance (#968) (#986)
- A store at the current schema revision skips init's write batch (#1001) (#1010)
- Probe before the pipe, not inside it (#462) (#904)
- Widen _wait_pidfile's window and name what it saw (#595) (#797)
- Stand down instead of an unfiltered watcher when a resumed seat is unidentified (#982) (#993)
- Refuse to guess between multiple installs on --update with no --cmd (#659)
- Write Codex writable_roots through a symlinked config.toml instead of replacing the link (#747) (#995)
- Stop the apply failure path from discarding the shell's stderr (#974)
- Stand down when the installation is updated underneath (#963) (#965)

### Performance
- Batch the rollout mtime scan (#1035) (#1037)

## [1.2.3] - 2026-08-22

### Added
- Emit push.posted when the POST is over, before the acks are written (#918)

### Fixed
- Name the sync engine in the update warning, not just watch.sh (#964)
- Reap a same-(project,role) orphan before spawning (#906 link 2) (#943)
- Preserve exact identity pairs in check-inbox (#721)
- Exit when another writer owns the thread (#906 link 1) (#935)
- Make the failure cap reach and bound the re-arm rate (#906 link 3) (#941)
- Retry a busy apply that races EPIPE, keeping the hung-driver bound (#931)
- A pulled field that is an array must not become shell words (#930)
- Report a busy store as busy, not as a failed check, and wait for it (#920)
- Say which check returned 13 (#911)

### Performance
- Index the two lookups that made import scale with the store (#956)
- Quote SQL literals with a bash expansion, not a fork (#948)
- A release PR is a version bump, not a third full matrix (#945)
- Parse a pull page with one jq, framed by NUL, with no eval (#908, #940) (#942)
- Check a pulled wire id without a process (#939)
- Find the first gap once, not once per candidate (#932)
- One jq per acknowledgement, not six forks (#927)
- Quote each pulled message's fields once, not at 42 fork sites (#908) (#925)
- Index events.legacy_id, looked up by value everywhere (#926)

- Pass the history and unread-marker SQL on stdin (#777) (#899)
- Pull a team larger than a command line, and say what it is doing (#882) (#895)
- Keep the binding a re-point replaces instead of destroying it (#884)

- Derive --update's type re-detection from the same list as TPL_TYPE (#846) (#880)
- Take the basename of the whole ps comm path (#770) (#771)
- Map grok-build to grok in the pid walk (#860)
- Fold sentinel '-' into the empty session-id path (#857)

### Documentation
- Say that main takes squash commits only (#845)

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- Windows can use the hosted service: connect reaches the server, the fingerprint is real, and doctor names a wedged lock (#868)

### Fixed
- Bound the wait on the local child without spawning anything to do it (#821)
- Record provenance when git answers in another path space (#830) (#842)
- Stop telling every agent that key rotate is unavailable (#841)
- The guard was on the wrong job's step, and it silenced a real one

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed
- The probe must not own a name two callers can share
- The probe needs jq's status too, and a cached refusal must still speak
- Require -b where sending needs it, and control the two values
- Ask jq for binary output, and refuse a jq that cannot give it
- Compare a command line and a path in one alphabet
- Control the retake, and correct what the field report actually was
- The cleanup after the wait must not speak for another engine
- Let go of the registry lock before waiting for readiness
- One cleanup path for the staged input, not two
- Stage the input only for the driver that holds the lock
- Hand the driver its input as a file, not down a pipe
- Take the name out of the test, and check the call not its spelling
- Check a pid we minted with the probe that can see it
- Cleanup does not get to speak for the write
- Write into a directory this call created, not a name it tested
- Create and fill the private temp in one redirection
- Create the private temp with builtins, not with mktemp
- Publish the new contents only if all of them were written
- Create the temp narrow instead of narrowing it after the write
- Write the team binding with a mode, not with the umask's leftovers
- An error page is not a protocol mismatch (#814)
- A start that never began is a failed start, not a silent return (#810)

### Documentation
- State the reason, not who gave it
- A pushed head is not a shipped one
- The header said builtins while calling three commands

## [1.2.0-rc.6] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- Do not start a team whose server has refused (#773)
- Start a connected team's engine when an agent turns up
- Keep the engine up when the server refuses, and let the reason be read
- Default to the whole installation, narrow with --project/--type/--team (#654)
- Say when another watcher is receiving for the same roles

### Fixed
- Close fd 3 and 4 on the spawn line, where the repo-wide check reads
- Give both sides of the probe the same remaining seconds
- Let the probe bound itself, and reap it before removing its files
- Reap a timed-out refusal probe instead of leaving it to the machine
- Put the refusal lookup under the same budget as the start
- Close every inherited descriptor in the background start, not just 0/1/2
- Stop asking whether the child is alive, and let go of the caller's streams
- Enforce the negative, keep the remedy runnable, and reap the deliberate children
- Cross each trigger, bound the wait, and make the assertions enforceable
- Delete the dead restore, and make degraded entropy refuse rather than guess
- Keep the holder beside the lock, and tidy it when the lock goes
- Keep the phrase callers already match on
- One token per lock, a holder that survives, and real entropy
- Prove the lock is ours before releasing it, and quote the remedy
- Budget the registry-lock wait in seconds, not in attempts (#779)
- Let a leaked registry lock say who left it, and that it is stuck
- Claim the pidfile before displacing the previous holder (#595)
- The child's stderr reaches the log undecoded
- A diagnostic never continues someone else's half-line
- Every log line names the process that wrote it
- Refuse a line carrying more than one JSON value (#780)
- Carry the detected type to the scripts that WRITE with it (#801)
- Validate the type the caller asked for, and stop dispatch guessing one (#783)
- Carry the reason when the binding path cannot be resolved
- Correct what the previous commit claimed about the identity catch
- Say which condition failed, and which field an exit came from
- Do not report a refusal older than the last successful cycle
- Make main's collapse reachable, and keep the path when it fires
- Deliver with exit 0 when the poll failed part-way (#658) (#745)
- Decide liveness with the EPERM-aware check, not a bare kill -0
- Let the filter file carry its own owner, so a predecessor cannot delete it
- Scope the sharing warning to one project, and describe before appearing
- Print a command per team, not a template with a hole in it
- Say the engine is not running, in both places that can say it

### Performance
- Read a pulled message with one jq, not eighteen (#780)

### Documentation
- Let the reversal record say one thing about why the start fails
- Narrow a claim I disproved myself two commits later
- Delete a comment describing the control this one replaced
- Point key.sh at the current design, and stop asserting the move has happened
- Move the connect onboarding design to agmsg-cloud, and drop labels that point at nothing
- Make the promise about this document weak enough to be true
- Label what stands behind each claim, instead of asserting they all cite
- Add a Japanese translation, and consolidate the derivation it mirrors
- Make the printed command cover the sentence it supports
- Widen the evidence to the tree, then widen the claim back to match it
- Say which path was measured, instead of calling it "the supported path"
- Trace the second route to age-v1 instead of leaving it open
- Name which half of the policy check protects you, and close the open question
- Audit the profile this document cites, and correct two claims it got wrong
- State what remote sync protects, and what it does not
- Say "documented, and measured otherwise" in all three places, not one
- Carry main's correction — the discard is documented, not measured
- Narrow the deletion rationale -- the subject was removed, not moved
- Remove two superseded designs, and stop citing one as normative
- Derive where the old ownership claim appears, instead of fixing the reported line
- The two files are removed by their owners, and those are not the same owner
- Make the comments say what the code now does

### Reverted
